I have a different project segment everyone has been working on so I guess we'll start with you Jake.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Uh I don't have anything to share tonight uh mostly just to monitor and meet new people and see what everyone is up to.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. That's Great. Yeah like um when people share their projects like you chime in and give your own opinion um what you feel about the project. Okay So how about Tenzin Elaine Allison what's cooking up at NySci? (laughter),0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I just finished a project on um...so basically like alright so basically we had this alumni for like...alright wait let me explain to this so for you know what NYSci is. So basically we're a science museum right? And then we had like these like interns I guess who threre on the like the museum floor and it's like tell the visitors how about museum and science stuff and then basically we interviewed one of the alumni um who is currently like she's in like the video production industry I guess. And yeah we interviewed her and I edited the video.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh cool. That's so cool. Do you have it on you? Can show it today or no?,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah. Yeah. I just posted a link on groupchat.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
OKay. Let's just go around and see what everyone's working on and then we'll come back to you alright Elaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Allison were you working...Allison and Tenzin were you working with Elaine or did you guys have separate projects?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well I actually was collaborating with someone from Kenya named Kimani.,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
We're doing this video on um broadcasting and sports and sort of a from...I'm Lagging?,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think...you lag on my end.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK. Yeah we can hear you.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Should I speak slower or something?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
No it’s fine. I think you're a good pace.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK. Um I'm collaborating with Kimani from Kenya and we're making a video on broadcasting and sports um and how that's changed from back then verses now and how technology is sort of changed our way of viewing sports. And I'm actually filming it tomorrow.,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Cool. So Yeah do you have a video?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh okay. I guess look me up on my next meeting for that one then.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
How about you Allison? Anything good?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK. So I'm kind of lagging out. I'm doing the call from my basement so its a bit a bit on the...I think I was talking about...I'm not sure but Allison I was asking about your project.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I just started a new video for NYSCI. Um it's basically...,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
A lot of people don't know what this is like it was fun. It's about ASMR which is like a type of it's a trend I guess on YouTube. And um I...we filmed last week so now I'm in the process of editing that video right now. So yeah.,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Hey its Danielle. I just wanted to chime in. I'm curious a little bit more can you talk a little bit about what that is ‘cause I have no clue what you yourself just said it's not very well known so I'm like tell us about it.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
It's basically well ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response which is like um its basically when someone makes a video where they like talk really close to the microphone but they like make really weird sounds next to the microphone and it's like it's become really popular um on YouTube Instagram stuff like that. Yeah. it's cool.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm going to post example from YouTube in the chat.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
But if you get the idea of what if like.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Actually would You mind like bringing it up because you have the ability to screen share.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
So if you want to screen share I just it doesn't just go down a little green button that says screenshare. Its like exactly in the middle. Do you see it?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh. Oh wow. Okay. Wait who do you want to screen share?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Um whoever has the video up and ready.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh well plus...I'll screenshare. Okay. Let's see.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Alright can everyone see it? Let me see. What is this?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah. All right. So this is really bad wait okay nevermind I got it. Oh my God Its nine seconds long.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is a bad video actually well alright. Oh yeah. You get to see it basically he has the microphone and it's um all this random things and then um making sounds with them in the microphone and for some people its satisfying and it gives them some meaning.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Yeah. You never heard of this Danielle?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Um no. Has anyone else that's not at NYSCI heard of this before?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
You guys never heard of this? That's crazy.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Look look how popular it is? It's pretty popular like.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh yeah look at this one.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Actually Jake have you heard of this? You're usually the techie one.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have heard of it but I've never really seen anything to do with it. I've heard the term but I've never actually took the time to explore what it was.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I bet...I Think you save a lot of time.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
And oh Denis is on the screen right now. Did you hear this? I don't know if you're still with Christine and Lameck but.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't think he is. Not sure he's moving around right now. He walked away.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah I've never. This is...how do I say this...strange.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's a pretty interesting concept. I didn't really believe it when someone described it to me at first an actual thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait so I'm some curious Allison what is it that you're going...you're going to do one or are you going to explain...what is it that you're doing?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
The video that I'm making. It's basically like with science behind it and like um we're Going gonna have like examples I had like a bunch of different people from NYSCI so I do like some more. Yeah.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay cool. That sounds Interesting actually. So I think down to Lameck and Christine now. Do you guys have a project? or are you guys been working on?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh they just said they can't hear us. so we have to speak louder. instant Message.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hi. Have you guys been working on a project?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh so I was working on a project on the Sustainable Development Goals. So I was working on Goal 6 which is clean water and sanitation.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Cool. You guys make um.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I didn't get the last part. Could you repeat it again?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Uh I was working on one of the Sustainable Development Goals which was clean water and sanitation.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Alright. So I guess well start with Elaine then. So um Elaine just like do you have a You-tube link to your project?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Do you havea Youtube Link to your project? That You Can all look or you can screenshare as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah okay. I'm gonna screenshare it then. ummmmmm Okay. So. You guys see the screen?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Of one go to. Oh there you go okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah. Wait you guys wanna watch the video? You guys can't hear the audio so its not that interesting. I posted a video of just the interview. It's probably not that interesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Um you could just post a link on it just in case someone does want to hear it I mean I can hear the audio as well. Wait no nevermind. We cannot. That was in my head after editing all those videos the intro is in my head now.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
We actually should be able to hear it unless there is no sound on that video.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm wearing wait. Wait. Let me like...wait.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Uh okay. I think you drew across the screen.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK. There you go. Oh there you go. Do you hear it now?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Alright. So I kind of had a chase bus because I keep on losing connection. So OK so Danielle's gonna take off like five minutes but I'm over it. And While I'm gone you guys can talk about your project and like what you thought and give your opinion and what you thought of it.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
But it's kind of funny right. Has Tenzin and Allison have you seen this video already?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I actually worked on it. I was audio for the video. Sorry for interrupting Allison. It was really cool to watch her in person also it was inspiring to me because she said to follow by her words.,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
Very cool. Allison were you going to say something?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh no this is my first time seeing it. But it was edited really well I think.,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh Elaine I suggest you show to the program next time.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
I was like why isn't their music...cause some,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh okay I see. I agree.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
How about Christine Lameck or Jake. Any thoughts?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Were you able to have any opinions about the video we just watched by Elaine?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Were You. Were you able to watch it. OK? Did it make sense? Or were you not able to hear it?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
We were not able to hear.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Well just in. There is a link in the chat window so you can watch it later too. If you wish.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I've also put the link into the agenda. So even if after you want to watch it you'll be able to.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think Jake maybe it was about to say something.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I one question one comment. My comment is. It was a very welldone video. Maybe so some constructive criticism is maybe have some more B-roll because I do video production at Spring Valley High School as well. So I make a lot of videos and B role is very important just so we're not constantly going back to that same interview. Other than that it was really good. Uh and yeah backup music would've helped. Uh and the question is how many people worked on the video? How big was a group?,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
Oh. All right thanks for the feedback. And um so all we did like okay so basically there was...we Had one director and we had like the person who is asking questions which was Ish actually right?,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was the one who actually uh was interviewing the alumni person.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
And then we had some person one-person audio. I think we have one person doing two cameras that's four people right. And then we had editor. Yeah. I think there's like a fifth person too who helped with camera at the end we' were doing we were doing B roll.,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh I am. Anyone else have a comment to make about the video? Yeah. I just want to add on to Jake's point like for the B-roll. Usually well when I was but I usually do it when I used to edit on ic4 like I'd be well and have like another B-roll after that instead of cutting back I must be very back down to her to her profile Maybe You can be a b-role and add to her profile that you're something good like doing like me in the future be like You have her profile and b-roll and different B-roll like that so string the b-rolls together more often I guess more often I guess. Yeah because you're just cutting back and forth which is just like it gets a bit like noxious I guess.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Cool.So um Tenzin do you have a video? Deal with video online so I have to actually disturb it much. Are you still working on it?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well the one I'm about to do I'm filming tomorrow but I have a really old video.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
On the bottom there's like a green button just go and I'll pop up oh she's on the way Tenzin.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think you should be able to. Danielle can confirm with that?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
You should be...because You can screenshare from your phone too.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh. Okay. Let Me try to figure this out.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait if you go to the bottom a green button It says Look share with the arrow thingy.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah it looks like something else but yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
What do I press after...oh screen. OK. Got it. Oh I have to go to settings. OK wait.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait I'm we'll put Tenzin on hold while she figures that out. Allison you still working on yours as well? right?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I also another reel that I,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. So I guess I'm just ready to set up and go?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. then while Tenzin works on that one I guess you can screenshare yours?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Uh this is a video that I made a while ago. A couple of months ago...that got posted. Okay. Okay. Can you see my screen?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah. we can see your screen.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh Alison are you showing your science and religion video?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cool. So I Think Jake somehow...is Jake still on the call? Can't tell.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
He was lost my screen. Like wait where did he go? OK. So does anyone have a comment so far about it? How about Lameck and Christine? What did you guys think about it? (pause) Not sure you hear me or not. Lameck and Christine can you guys uh you guys have a comment about Allison's video?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
You think uh ... About the video. It's very nice.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
What makes it nice to you in your opinion?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was also fooled by the optical illusions. So I learned a lot.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Alison I'm curious why you chose that.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Well um 'cause I was on Instagram one day and I saw like an optical illusion I was like wow that's really cool. so I like researched like the science behind it and that's what inspired me to make the reel.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
How about you Jake and you have some video production experience right?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah. I liked the video. It was very well done as well. Um I'd say it should be a little longer. It covered the topics pretty fast and it was hard to take all this in cause it goes over different concepts a little bit too fast. And It was just a little hard to keep up with the pace of the video so I think you should maybe expand on it and make another video that's longer and goes over each aspect of the illusion. And maybe go over different types of optical illusions as well.,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Does anyone else have a comment to make?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Um I also agree but I think Allison um I think you did a good job though like trying to make it concise in a way. And I was also on set as a director and the lighting was so bad and I think it was edited well enough to make it look good so yeah.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Ok so I agree with Jake. It went a bit fast as well but I do understand because you have like a...I understand that you guys have a four-minute five minute limit on your videos cause from personal experience so so what you could do then instead of like I'm not sure if this has been done before but you can make a part-one video part 2 video and part 2 can go more in-depth into it. And part one has more of a general aspect general information of optical illusions but if you just like just like not go too much into details yeah or give them like reference links if they want to understand more about optical illusion and stuff. Okay cool. Um Tenzin how's your video?,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Can you guys see it? I'll start it from the beginning.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Um your audio is not there but.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did you a hand make the subtitles? I mean hand write the subtitles?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe actually...could somebody else maybe pull it up on their computer so we can...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Cause this is on You-tube right so we.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. so um. Um wait what's the video called?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Come build your own group goldbreak machine I think.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
You kind of look like the references come up.And you see the different type of references that You-tube has for you?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I think she just went on the YouTube channel. There you go. This one.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did you build one yourself yet or no?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did you build a Rube Goldberg machine yourself yet or?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Uh no. I could have never...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I really like the way it was edited. I liked the b roll...of the kid actually..like... on the machine.,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well it's like the breakdown of who did what for the video?,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well I actually was sort of supposed to do a last-minute um Beck just came to me and asked me to do audio and her and Kevin were doing camera A and camera B because you could see the two camera angles switching and then Jayde was just interviewing the director sort of on how to build it.,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah that was me. I also edited it.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Yeah. Guys it's like if you guys worked on a project of someone else's just mention it so we know and you're not gonna find out later you know. Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's actually my first editing job so.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Was there anything you learned in the process?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Um it takes a lot of revisions to make sure to get the perfect one to go up on YouTube.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah I feel it. Okay. Um So okay. Uh So how about Jake Lameck and Christine? How do you guys feel about video? Does it make you like want to go and build a Rube Goldberg machine because he knows the purpose of the video right?,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
As for me I enjoyed the video but I have a question. So what do work on that machine?,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
What is the what? I didn't hear the middle part sorry.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
She's asking us to work on the machine like what's the function of the machine?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Um basically you sort of have an object at the beginning and it goes through a long obstacle course sort of. And at the end the purpose of the one in the video was to hit the bell um but a lot of other people make it to do maybe close close a door or something. There's like a bunch of purposes that it can fulfill. You should try one.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Do you understand more about the machine? or do you like need a little more elaboration? Great. Okay yes. How about you Jake?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah I'd like to say because you're inviting other kids and other people to come to New York Hall of Science to partake in this correct?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah I mean I was idea in video right?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I'd say in the video you might want to explain what is a Rube Goldberg machine.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Because correct me if I'm wrong but it's a machine that's overcomplicated to do a simple task right?,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
So I think maybe just added at the beginning the video so it's not you have to do this one task you can do several things anyway you want. I think that would make it more broad and help like little kids understand who might not know what this is. Other than that it was good editing good lighting overall good video.,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah. I'm gonna mention that too. Yes. I'm gonna casually just chilling on his shoulder.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah. This is Aries. He's a bearded dragon.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Cool cool. Cool Little lizard.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
So um. I Think that covers most people's project stuff. Um Lameck and Christine do you guys have a popup-like a video. I mean have a PowerPoint or a video of some kind? (2-second pause) It's totally fine if you don't have any. I was like wondering if you guys have anything to share today.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
For me I don't have a video. Mine is just a lot of explanations.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's totally fine. It's totally fine. It's perfectly fine.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Can you explain. Are you okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. So as I told you I yeah I was working on one of the Sustainable Development Goals that is clean water and sanitation. So other than that uh I was just looking for some of the creative ways in which uh we can use to enhance clean water and uh good sanitation apart from the government's initiated methods. So other than that I was about to explain how we can purify water and we have several ways in which you can use to purify water. We can boil we can use chlorine and other chemicals. So I had an interesting uh method. You can also use the UV rays to purify water and uh according to research it is one of the best way of purifying water because according to statistics it is stated that it kills almost ninety-nine point ninety-nine percent of their micro-organisms but as for me I want to prove that it is the best way so with that I want to maybe do some...go to the lab test and uh test if up we refine water with the UV rays it is the best way of refining water I want to prove to people that uh it is the best way I want to prove if it kills almost 99 percent of micro-organisms that water we drink because if you can see that now a days many people are suffering with these kind of diseases like cholera and uh maleria which are bad diseases. So as for me I just had that now under. I also posted that question for you to help me in answering that question. I think you look at it later.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Alright. The other question where did you post the question? (13 second pause) Where did you post the question?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh Christine just go ahead and ask it. Just ask it.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
It's in the agenda Ish. It's on towards...but Christine do you want to go ahead and just tell us what the question? What is the question? Just tell us.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ok. Uh Apart from the the government-initiated methods that the government is using to enhance clean water and sanitation what are the other creative ways which we can use because we can see that creativity is one of the 21st century skills. So what are some of the other creative ways that we can use to maybe deal with this uh issue of clean water and sanitation? So that was my question.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Okay. Well for me this is the first time I've heard of you UV rays. But I think it's a brilliant idea.,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
You come up with it? That's great.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
So uh the idea I got it from a magazine. I read it from a magazine and I decided to go deeper and explain how it works. So you consider the UV rays a form of killing the DNA so killing the DNA prevents the organism from reproducing. So I'll go ahead and explain more when I prepare a Sway or a video. I am not yet through with that...that project so when I get through I think... uh I'll explain more and more. Yeah.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. An Interesting idea...to share that an interesting idea is that... the um...do you know how the antibiotics when like when people abuse antibiotics sometimes there are bacteria that grow resistant to it is...you might want to look into if possible for some bacteria you become resistant to the UV rays of treatment. That's something if you want to look at as well. Okay alright. So like does anyone have an answer to um Christine's question that she mentioned earlier? Um that's a pretty tough question. Scientists have been dealing with it for a long time. I was just asking if anyone else could answer your question. To add something to answer your question.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
Some of it is add to that. Um it's not my idea. It's something that's actually in use right now. I live in Las Vegas and our local water source is from Lake Mead and we have to treat that water before we can use it. So we have a wastewater treatment plant here outside of town where they actually use ozone purify the water because ozone actually kills viruses and 100 percent of all bacteria and fungus. It's not cheap but it's a very effective way at purifying water that's actually in use and I think that could be something you could talk about as well uh with your research and one thing I would like to ask is how cost effective is the UV radiation for purifying water and how can you apply UV radiation in that scale? I know they make UV whites. Like I have a UV lamp here for my lizard but which is just a giant scale version of that or is there another way to apply UV radiation to the water? Is my question.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
Okay cool. That's also a pretty valid point cost effectiveness of actually treating the water itself. So yeah Christine like when you're doing more of your research you might want to find out whether it's actually cost effective to use UV to treat water.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Food. How about the group from from NYSci. Do you guys have a comment?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't know that much about purifying water so I don't want to butcher anything and contribute anything that's not of any use so.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
I mean it doesn't have to be...like what you think about the idea. Do you think it's like a...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh I didn't really. Yeah I think it's really interesting. I've never heard about UV rays stuff like that and I think it'd be informative for a lot of people.,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maybe you and Christine can like collaborate. Like she can give you the research and you can make a video about you know UV rays. That'd be pretty cool right?,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Like both of you can help each other out. They anyone not having other comments? OK. So I think this meeting has been pretty good so far. Oh. we all talked about it things as anything anyone wants to mention before we start closing off? (pause). No?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well Lameck were you going to talk about.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
maybe I think you were going to mention a project you were doing. (pause) Yes you.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. My project was...uh about technology project but let me share about the one I'm doing currently in the process is about trapping of sunlight and is an idea that just came up in the mind because how to make work easier because the sun's energy it can be used in so many ways. It can you know help in the same way you find water and also you know heating whereby you know can be used as...I don't know how to explain it really but uh. So maybe I get back to you after I'm done with that research exactly but now let me share about what I understand well. It's about anti-gravity. So the idea was you know gravity how to you know reduce the gravity itself and to be free from gravity and uh. So we have...let me see an anti-gravity so. we love love low gravity capacities of gravity on a large scale. It's an idea that came up in my mind of how to make work easier using...how to raise boulders you know raising boulders is much harder when you have gravity. So I found out a way on how to reduce gravity and you can raise the boulders. Heavy heavy heavy materials to higher ground so I want to learn the gravity human brain and uh everything about using a magnet. Those are my projects.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Alright that sounds pretty cool. But that's a lot too. Must keep you busy. Yeah um...Could you elaborate monitoring like antigravity thing is like a machine or is it like a concept or something?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Not really like a machine but rather it's a setup this setup can reduce gravity so that I say that it's called the antigravity. So you create like a UFO unidentified flying object. So yeah. So that UFO can reduce gravity and uh so that region that you have the setup can...,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay so are you still working on the setup?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. Cool cool cool. So you want to get that done. That sounds pretty cool.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
So the setup it includes of uh simple household things,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Just simple household items such as you know glass aluminum foil...,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Sorry Lameck we didn't actually say anything but we missed a little bit of what you said you were talking about the materials. All we heard was aluminum foil...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Things cut off from there. I thought it was just me. 'Cause no one else was saying anything.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was saying starting from glass you know basic things of getting into you can start from using a glass. Aluminum foil and you know and steel and copper coins. So we have this setup you will find out that they set up the job get it using the glass aluminum foil the copper coins and bedsheets it you start to know the will be looked at it and then did so start using that concept it can the quantity will allow that each anti-gravity so region that is not up to now be in the act to do so the region will be free of gravity and that gets the job. So that's just the basic concept about anti-gravity so using this concept can get a region gravity. Whereby uh I only know this goes but I wish to create that larger region of about 1 kilometer free of gravity.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
During a mini set up already in many by my eye you can show us. I you still working on it?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
So for now I have a Sway. So I'm looking for a video. It does give you some time soon. The video is coming very soon. Oh no. I shall. Yes you do. Guys. Yeah.,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I mean if you want you can share us the Sway.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah.You can like screenshare the Sway and walk us through it. That would be pretty cool.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me just share this Sway. (pause) Just a moment.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Take your time. Anyone else have like a question about the gravity machine while you pull it up?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wait. Did you see the chat?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The chat window. There are some questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh. Okay. (mumbling) Also I think he mentioned earlier that like when lifting heavy objects he wants to reduce the work needed to like reduce the objects. That's why he wants to reduce gravity. He doesn't have a prototype. He's working on it. And why do you need to use materials. And how would you make the inside anti-gravity? I think he's still researching it and his own prototype.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Okay. (10 SECOND PAUSE) So the mic there's a quick question about why you need to use materials.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Why do you need those materials?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Really. That's the problem. It is in the Sway. So let me just show you. I'll answer your questions right there. (17 second pause) He can just continue. (nine second pause),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know as you're talking Lameck I'm wondering if maybe somebody here um in one of the other sites might you do a mini prototype of what you're saying like a quick video for you to incorporate into your project your project. You're saying that's very simple materials right?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
I made a prototype in the video you can see.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Wow that's really cool. You think I can build a prototype right now?,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Can you? Do you have the materials? Wait...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Right now. What makes you think that inspires you right now? Well I mean like he said you can use household items. I'm assuming you have most of them home. I didn't know you could build like some kind of gravity machine with household items. I think that's really interesting.,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
You know this is the introductory part that's introduced about so I use gravity to introduce about gravity first so that you not just really get the concept itself. Then now uh out of the links you can learn more about gravity from the things that are here that you can see. That now now this the antigravity part (laugh) Yeah so the objective...the objective here so the antigravity was just an idea of creating here that is free from the force of gravity. So that's all about antigravity then uh it was discovered by uh genetic illusion Podkletnov he is a Russian physicist then uh... It also been accepted by the NASA. And now as you know these are the materials that you need and their functions. So as you can see there is one glass which is best to hold the larger coin and the phone. You also need a phone to the larger coin. So those two copper coins; one; will be out of the bottle outside of the glass the other one will be inside the glass; so it's just like know then kitchen foil that is the me then uh that's just job the microwave in a way that is produced by the vibrations then uh the sticky tape that's what holds the glass together will be conducted then a phone the phone now you keep it inside the glass so inside so the glass will be the you know uh just the pressure itself will be conducted to use the microwave energy; so next you put everything you put which after you know the kitchen foil will you know like wrap it around the glass so when you wrap it around the glass now you put them at you test them. Look at this procedure yes its see uh so you stick the small pennies uh the pennies more pennies now piece of paper in the glass the larger point in the glass on the phone You put pressure on you know uh not the other way round so the impression model so that you can reduce the with chemical energy then you wrap the entire glass with kitchen foil. Then uh now you make a point-stick and wrap around the top of the bedsheets to connect then just place on the ground outside so when the spread the bedsheets around the glass you spread them equal distances them equal distances then you pay them the you know then start to dip then uh place it outside. Then the phone that is that the glass you hold it that can be you in it. Then they break. Then after some time you'll see the glass rising.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let me see if I can show you on Youtube. Just see if I can show you on YouTube.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Really interesting. I've never heard of this before.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ish check on the Chat window.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
So the guys at NySci you should try building this as well right?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah 'cause we have a lot of materials.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Well I think I care about it like I hope like literally but like I think are outside right? Let's again do it outside.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I mean Lameck do have to do it outside?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Lameck Did you hear that? Is there do can you do it outside? Do you have to do it. Can you do it inside?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
Outside. But outside. Well you know Inside the house will not be effective as much as it would be outside. That's why it’s recommended it outside. I would say that better experience going to get you to.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Thank you for clarifying and good question Elaine.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah you see so too is start rising some type.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
That's for them to go to but now that's from household items but there is another setup that I need to share but I'll share it soon it to you now. See the display at the house. I didn't I just did this to make the poster come out clearly but. try them now Now the other way there's another way to get that gravity now on the larger region. As I say be up to one kilometer so it really needs a lot of you know it starts under you know setups. That's why you know...really need that,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Before you start on your one kilometer project I should probably start on a smaller scale like try making them try making like a smaller version of it and I'm like show it to us as well. We'll do you like the people at NYSCI try to build one. Once you have your set up and instructions maybe you then you can post instructions like the materials so that people at NYSCI can make one of their own right? That way you can check out if you like rises in different heights in different places. And that might be something interesting to explore as well. And once you get a prototype done so you can get other people involved to make it as well. Okay. cool. Does anyone else have any ideas or questions about the anti-gravity machine?,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
I agree with what Ish said. It looks like you would like labs where these kind of experiments is always better to do like a small scale because you waste of time.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah. Um Hi Zach. I do have a project something I want to talk about my question. Hi Zach.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I don't have any questions...just learning from you.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
OK. Cool. So does anyone they don't have anything else I feel like they have any questions and he has no one mentioned before you start closing off officially now.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I have one question. Kind of a long one. Um anitgravity because it's the force of foerces repelling each other right to create lift off of gravity creating anti-gravity. And you say you want humans that will fly in a way like birds. My question is if you're in the air how would you create the momentum to be able to move while experiencing this anti-gravity? What would You be able to move stuff over this one kilometer hypothetically or do you need more research on that? That's my question.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
OK. You see now antigravity concept as I said on the uses of the importance one of them is the ability to three months to fly so that's important so that one I was saying that going another setup but not the not the one that is shared so maybe when I'm done that the other setup so I just shared it with you and now you'll see where the it does so humans the ability for months to fly comes up altogether. Yeah.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay cool. Thank you for the explanation Lameck.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'm looking forward to what you come up with. I think you'll be really cool.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah that sounds coolI've never seen something like that before so that sounds really interesting as well. Okay. Um. So is everyone good? Yes Danielle?,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was just going to say for reference um I put Lameck's Sway into the agenda. So a list of materials and whatnot is in there. It's easy for anyone to kind of take a look up and explore to create a prototype he is suggesting.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Okay. So um I guess this is a good meeting guys. Okay. Well thanks for showing up. Make sure you leave make sure you do reflections because they are important. Okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I'll go ahead just because you know this might not be a familiar scenario to anyone want to go ahead and put the link to the agenda in the chat window right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh we put that up already. All right.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Oh you did? So everybody everybody already saw it then.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
I guess some post it again to be on the safe side. Just on the safe side. All right. Cool. Thank you everyone. Danielle you staying on afterwards to talk with me?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Yeah. And I just want to echo um Ish thank you. great job. And everyone please please um fill out the reflections. And I know that it's late or in some cases very early for everyone. But soon after even if it's a little bit short it's helpful because you're not going to have the same feelings that you have on if you fill it out later on. So if the moment is really ideal. Get it out of it take care of it. So I hope to see you there in typing in the reflections.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
All so much for joining me this evening. And this morning. Appreciate it.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 School is great.  Uh we are doing well and uh we are happy to join the meetup and I'm looking forward to chatting more about school. As for now the exam the exams are going for tomorrow and next week and the other week. But we still do our projects in the afternoons. And yeah that's what I can say.,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Well it's so great to have you guys on but I understand I understand that right now you have closed school and we are all happy that you are able to join the meeting and as we wait for the others to join I hope you all have fun and learn more from each other. I can see that we have a number of people. Yeah. So.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I guess we can start.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I think. Yeah I think. Yeah we definitely have... I see many people on the screen so. Yeah just I guess. Yeah we can. I think we can get started. If you haven't done so already please press on the the gallery view. It's on the upper right hand side. And if you click on that you'll see everyone's pictures the same size and you'll be able to see everyone at the same time. So yeah with that I hand it over. I'll hand it over to Eunice to start the meeting.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
 OK. Thank you all for joining. I would like us to know each other first because some of us are meeting new faces today and I will start. My name is Eunice Margaret.

 My name is Vicente Lagunas and I go to UNLV and I'm excited to work with you guys to hear your ideas.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 But to learning more about climate change from from you.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I guess I can go. Hi I am Seung and I am part of the IC4 research team at Pepperdine University. Good to meet you all.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Hello my name is Veera. I am from Finland. I am and I am -- how do you say -- Country leader but I am also teaching the Finnish group.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Hi. I hope you are hearing well. (Seung gives thumbs up) Yeah good. I am Elia from Finland too and I'm studying in college. It's my last year before university so I'm really excited. Yeah.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Can you hear me? Oh yeah. I'm Toivo. I am from Finland but right now I live on Svalbard and I'm a student in online school in Finland. And yeah looking forward to this.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Well if there is none else left in the introduction I'll just like to highlight some things a number of rules. If you are not supposed to be talking please have your microphone mute so that you don't distract the voice from other people. Then yeah. I think that's basically the thing. So. Today I'm very excited. We're going to talk about climate and the country too. To see and listen to their presentation that we have from the Finland students. So we'll first wait for them to finish their presentation before you have questions or even suggestions to them and help them with their class project. So I'll hand it over to I think it was to Denis to start us off.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
 OK. So Elia or Toivo which one of you wants to tell them first?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Maybe Elia you can start. Okay.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah. Let's see if I can do this correctly. At least I think so. (Speaking Finnish). How am I supposed to share my like you for you guys?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 You have to click on that share button that green one.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 And then show us your file.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah this is mine. So I think I'm doing something about eating habits cause of course it's different here in Finland than it's in anywhere else and... Let's see if I can do this. Yeah and I think I'm doing this for health like the major seven groups of food because there are so many things that are so differently than it was before. So yeah I think I'm comparing the Finnish ones to USA and if someone wants to do it with me then I'll be glad to take it to you in mind also. And all the chains I think I'm focusing naturally on the milk about Finland cause that's been something we've taught since we're rookies that we need to drink it. And that's not to case. You don't mean to drink milk to you just need to get things that you get from milk. And there are so many alternatives nowadays. And I think I like to see where that work is going and what kind of other foods have changed. Yeah I think I have one video about it's this milk commercial and I like to use it in my presentation probably. Yeah. Yeah. There it is. Food is something that I think shows greatly what climate change can do to something that we need to deal with every day like we need to eat and climate change changes that so many ways that I once find out that different kinds of changes even more than I have already found. So yeah there are like things that I need to do in this person's case. And as you can see and the major one is using English because it's so used to me like mix English and Finnish together. So yeah I need to focus on staying in English and doing this project with someone else would actually help me a lot because then I'd have to be explaining it as well. So yeah I think that's my presentation. (Everyone makes clapping motions).,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
 Whoo! Thank you so much Elia. So Elia wants people who can help with the other foods with regards to climate? So we'll have that later on. So we can have the other -- the other person if there is,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 So yeah. I live here on Svalbard and I was thinking that maybe I should make a presentation about the climate change here because it has really affected this place. I live in the most northernmost city in the world. So there is a lot of things you can see seen here. That is because of climate change. And I can take pictures and stuff but I haven't really started it because I've been little busy and stuff. But yeah.,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I found Elias's project really interesting because compared to Finland we Americans are mostly fast food chains and I think we're considered just the most obese country in the world because of it (laughs).  (lot of background noise) So maybe I can add on something that's from America to your project.,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Okay. Jennifer is there something you're trying to do?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Oh are you trying to put on something?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Oh I was thinking of adding on what kind of foods Americans eat what Finland's eat and how like there so different. In terms of health maybe as well.,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
 Oh OK. Thank you. So is then yeah that presentation with regards to the same--.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Well at that point I think if the presentations are over we can have input from from all of us so that you can help in making these projects more better. Elia asked for ideas and opinions so we can have yeah some of you to give their opinions and ideas.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
 Hi everyone can you hear me? (thumbs up motions),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah we can hear you.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Ah good right. Thank you so much Elia for sharing about your exciting presentation on alternative's of milk. And also for Jennifer accepting to be part of that project. So I have a question not just to Elia but to everyone on the call. Because this project is about climate change. Why does it matter to use alternatives of milk? How does that relate to climate change? So this is a question to all of us not specifically to Elia but Elia you're most welcome to to contribute too. Thank you.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 OK so we have Zach there asking us a question. Actually it's a challenge. So any uh why is it important to use alternatives of milk with regards to climate change? So anyone please?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 No I believe that if climate change is affecting the milk and the things we eat... Well yeah. It's something that we're gonna eat and it's going to affect our health. So we need to take action in order to reduce how climate change is affecting the things we eat.  ,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I believe that a lot of it has to do with dependency of cows and dairy farms. When cows are killed or they're consumed they release a lot of carbon emission. So if we use alternatives that can sort of get rid of the dependency of milk. So the necessity of that wouldn't be as important.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah I think that's something that we as people can do like we can't control everything but we can control our actions and not drinking milk or using dairy is just something that. Well it's I don't say it's easy but it's easier than doing something very big. But it's still make -- It still makes a difference. So I think that's why drinking alternative versions to milk would be important. And then it can like go.. Oh you can like share your cause and you can like meet other people who are vegas or are vegetarians or just interested about climate change or nature. So that's always important too.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah. So I was thinking about apart from milk was uh I thought of milk being something probably... I don't know if it's advisable to take milk during colder climate or warm so I just thinking about if it's cold we can have warm milk right? It guess warm then cold during warm times. It's advisable to take cold milk probably in the morning or in the afternoons. Then apart from milk we can probably use a type of protein food like potatoes would be advisable too. And something in like..,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Or maybe cheese? I guess so. But milk. Milk is recommended both cold and warm. Yeah.  ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Well Lameck I have a question to you. You said that during cold seasons you take... Is it warm milk?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 Then during warm seasons you take cold milk. Why is it? So why should we consider that?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 Okay. Considering that milk is a protein so protein is probably also will tend to reduce the dehydration during the warm climate. So during the warm climate having cold milk maybe you make mashed potatoes. So that's why I think potatoes would be a very good alternative. If you can't take milk because I understand that some people are probably taking cold milk in the morning kind of you know not fitting their health. So I thought of taking mashed potatoes maybe breakfast then in the evening. Probably not even dinner. You can have it before the dinner. The main meal. So that's I thought potatoes and milk kind of go hand in hand.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 OK. Thank you. Any other person who wants to react on the question that Mr. Zach asked? Why -- Why is it important to use alternatives of milk? Collins or Christine do you have anything to say?  ,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I think it's important to use the alternative for milk so that you're able to maintain  the initial.  For example you see that some nutrients which are generated by milk (inaudible-audio cutout). So If you use the alternative (inaudible) same as provided by the  milk.  [13.0s]  So your body will lack -- will not lack the nutrients which it was processing before. Using alternatives you retain the nutrients which you are using before by getting them from the milk.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 And also protein. I understand Maybe I don't I'm not sure. But I guess biologically during warm climate we tend to use a lot of energy compared to cold climate. So I thought having a broad alternative apart from milk another protein food would be advisable because you know of the energy and the body building. Yeah.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I wanted to add on...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Oh sorry. I wanted to add onto...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 ...about how food can be affected because of climate change and having alternatives for milk can be very useful because of cows are where you get milk from. It can have can be negatively affected by the extreme climate changes the weather patterns like the rise in carbon emissions which can affect their health which in turn makes the milk bad for you to drink. But if we have other alternative choices we can we can still get the nutrition nutrients we wanted. But it's gonna be from some other source where it's healthier than cows or goats or any others.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Thank you Jennifer.  So we have another question from Zach. He's asking how does carbon emissions affect climate change? Any reactions? How does carbon emissions affect climate change?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 I think when carbon are emitted in the atmosphere  [00:25:26]fastly they can interfere with the ozone which in turn enables the sun rays to penetrate more  [0.0s] into the atmosphere. So when they penetrate more fast into the atmosphere they bring about desertification which may affect some of the productivity of the land. So this might affect even the milk in the sense that there'll be no food for the cows as the production of the milk will go down.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 And also for the more this indirect effect of the carbon emission we'll see that that might cause acid rain. So the acid rain will alter the normal growth of the vegetation by which the desertification or the encroachment of the desert will enlarge. So in that case it might cause the hot climate to you know it would be unfavorable for the cows to produce the milk. So that's how I think carbon emission affects climate change.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
  Carbon emission can also cause global warming as we all know. The effects of global warming therefore affecting the... the climate.  Yeah and the atmosphere.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 For me again it has a lot to do with dependency cow breeding is a major part of the emission of greenhouse gases and when they emit they stay in the lower atmosphere causing the earth to heat up and the energy balance of the earth to become unstable. And so when that happens the like like we said the agriculture the climate the environment will change drastically. And that can affect a lot of the livestock the plants and the animals.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Thank you Vicente.  Anyone else wants to give uh?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Victor you have something to say?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Greenhouse gases increases the chance of um of the temperature increasing. It increases chances of having wildfires and droughts and tropical storms at other places which in turn endangers us humans when we don't have supplies to water because of carbon emissions.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
" To add on to what Vincent said when the carbon are emmitted into the atmosphere they require Oxygen from a carbon (inaudible) forms the blankets
beneath the atmosphere which enables the sun rays ability to get into the atmosphere but they did become unable to go back. So this is when the sun rays (inaudible) they cause a
warming effect which is so the heat is retaining (inaudible) which is unable to escape.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
 So about the question what are the greenhouse gases? I know of one which is chlorofluorocarbons which is in short form CFC. So I know that one.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 So we know of those two as for now so chlorofluorocarbon and methane. So I guess for the chlorofluorocarbon I guess it works almost the same way as the carbon which is released into the atomosphere which  global warming desertification and the altering of the ozone layer. Yeah.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 And I have a question. So what are the natural causes of climate change? Apart from the greenhouse effects?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 According to - okay Veera asked about the greenhouse gases related to cows and uh...I think there is no direct effect of the gases to the cows. Apart from inhalation so probably most of them are indirect. That's including the carbon emission and chlorofluorocarbons and the methane so all of them will affect the cows indirectly but there is no immediate direct effect. Apart from inhalation of the gases. So the toxic gases which are released probably when the ranch is near an industry so that's when they may inhale just the same way as two humans. Then we may be affected and their production will be it will be really low. Yeah.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Wait are you arguing that cows have no direct effect on carbon emissions and climate change? Is that what you are arguing?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 OK. We are trying to say that any external gas from the atmosphere does not affect the cow.  But we understand that the cow releases up to about 70 to 120 KGs of methane which are released into the environment. They might also cause they have a negative effect to the environment. So the cow releases the methane but now there's uh... Through the cow dung. So the cow dung it has the methane. But any other external gas from the atmosphere I think doesn't affect the cow directly.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Hi. I had a question for Toivo actually. So Toivo mentioned that he is now living in the northernmost city in the world. Just wondering how do you think there has been any effect of climate change in the area that you're residing or living in?,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 Yeah actually it's.. Every summer it's a little bit warmer like this summer. It was I think the most was 14 degrees in Celsius. And that's a lot. And for example the ocean which is right in front of the city hasn't been frozen in 10 years. And before that it was always frozen by the time of winter. And and it seems that the snow is coming every year a little bit later. And you can really see the effects of climate change by just looking at the glaciers that are like the closest one to the cities just about 10 kilometers from the city. And it has really been just shrinking out from the city and all of the glaciers and stuff is just - if you want photos from 20 years or 10 years ago it's really a huge change.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah you can see same kind of changes in Finland actually. Like it's minus 7 degrees outside right now and it's unusual of this time of year. Like the winters are going to be longer but not as cold. And there's not like there's not been as much snow as I remember in my childhood.  Like last year the snow was - it wasn't in place that many days. And there was this like colder season came like as early I think. But it came again like near spring and it was actually snowing in spring. And it was quite scary I think cause you can actually see the changes like through your own eyes. You can actually see that yeah there's snow as there is not as much snow and the colder weather and there are so many like the like summers are kinda warmer I think but they are... There's been more raining and everything like that. So I was wondering if it's the same around world. Cause like I said I can like totally agree. You get to see those kind of things. But I don't know if you're in Africa. If you can see that kind of changes because I've never been there or especially lived there.,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 I'm very sorry to interrupt but since I have to leave first class now I just wanted to say thank you for coming to the meeting and it was nice meeting all of you and I'm excited to work with all of you. Bye.  (waves goodbye).,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Oh to add on the question just about the natural cause of climate change we all know that climate change is caused by activity which are being carried out inside the atmosphere (cuts out). Apart from that their activities of your car outside the (cuts out). For example there are times where the earth is closer to the sun. This is a vast auditorium hellion period. When the sun is closer to the earth or the axis closer to the earth. The earth receive more temperature than any other period.  temperature in the earth  in the climate. So this is another external factor that causes climate change which is natural.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
 So and also natural causes are there is volcanicity. So volcanicity is when you know the lava moves from the magma moves from the interior of the earth onto the earth's surface and in that way emits some gases. So the gases are - that's when maybe it may you know because it's hot so it alters the normal temperature. And in that way it may cause the climate change in an area.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 And maybe to ask -  now what are the effects of the climate change the effects of climate change.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 I think the effects are different wherever you are like if you are in Finland you see different kinds of effects than you see in America. Cause like um climates like the rivers and oceans and stuff that changes climates. And so for example when usually you talk about climate change that the effects of climate change you think about certain areas. But overall things are that where it's dry it's going to be drier and worse. Like uh hot it's going to be like even warmer. So that kind of changes are like scientific facts that have been like written that yeah there are kinds of rules but there are not really rules. It's different from place to place. And I think that's the thing that sucks the most kinda cause you can't like you can't see five years for future. You can't see that what kind of changes are. You can just guess. And the most educated guess is the one that we are like given so we don't see that. Well in Finland you can see kind of like the discussion like what would be that much. You again see these. Yeah. There are like five things you need to know about climate change. You can see these professionally written articles and I think that would be like more important cause you don't know - there are too many variables to consider. So yeah.,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 OK. Yeah I think we we lost Eunice there. Yeah that's a great point. Let's see. Yes. And we. I'm looking at the chat window here and there was a question about is there a difference between weather and climate? And Vincente had a response. Weather describes day to day state while climate describes overall atmospheric state throughout a period of time. Did any other people have thoughts on this? The difference between weather and climate.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 Yeah. What Vicente is saying is actually the truth. But what I like to add on is that weather is normally determined day to day daily. But as for climate it is still usually determined within our long period of time that is maybe 30 to 35 years. Let me give us an example. Between the two.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
 So for example in Kenya the climate is warm. That was established over a long period of time for about 35 years. But now as for the weather right now it's hot. So hot that's weather. It's what is the weather for today. So it's not - it does not take in a long period of time just over a short period of time. That's when you determine the weather. But as for climate over a long period of time. So maybe tomorrow the weather might be rainy. So that's weather. So the difference is that is the time taken. So. (audio cuts out),1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah OK. I think we lost your audio there for for a moment Lameck.  But yeah. Thank you for that. Any other thoughts perhaps?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I have a question. So do you guys believe that climate change has a psychological effect on all of us? And if so how?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 Do you mean as in terms of mood? Or as in terms of like mental health?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 (cuts out) it could be both. So wherever it fits.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I don't know. I mean I live in Las Vegas so whenever it gets hotter here I'm always a bit like lazy I guess. A bit tired more tired because of the heat.  ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Um about the psychological effect of climate change abrupt climate change might alter the normal functioning of the brain. So in one way is the anxiety and you know the tension. For instance if we have cold climate then so a new climate has been established. And in that way for example glacier forms during cold times. And in that we probably only see the movement of glacier that may cause the tension. And also you know the encroachment of and decertification. It might also cause you know the tension and anxiety and all that. Also probably global warming. And you know also the way that the emission of the emission of the gases the toxic gases might really affect your brain. For instance chlorofluorocarbons might affect your brain in a way that (cuts out)  like uh literally eating up your brain and this - You might end up you know having a sort of short term memory. And also it might lead to many many problems which are like psychological.  ,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 And I think that stuff's in a biological way like you said about gases and that kind of stuff. But change always affects like your mental health like if you are moving a lot when you are children that affects you. And you can see the affect when in future. And like in Finland we probably like kind of parts of who we are is the fact that we live in Finland and we do with these kind of winter activities. That's that. That's just like part of us. So when climate change changes that and we can't go skiing or hiking or something like that in winter and we don't see snow. It can change the perception of us. And we need to rethink where we are and what kind of people we are if we are not Finnish and if we don't live here and how our culture takes the hit after climate change. And like how it affects our children. And if we move do we continue using Finnish language? And so on.  ,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Thank you. Oh just to add on. The effects of climate to the psychology for example Mombasa. This for example there's a rise in the sea level and the level of water increases. So this level of water may cause flood into the area land of course. When that’s so[00:51:24](inaudible-audio cut out)  death of animal and also people which may alter the how people percieve. They like they may be used to such horrible things. And also for example like they say in Mombasa when there is a climate change this example the high temperature. The people becomes they become more prone to sweating in the activity. They take most of their time and consider that. So if for example drinking water or (inaudible) we may affect the way of how they do things.,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Excellent. Yeah. Thank you for everyone's thoughts there. Just wondering Emily did you have any hypothesis or thoughts on on on how climate change and emotional health or psychological health whether there's any relationship between that?,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 Yes. So here in Long Beach where we live we live near oil refineries and us as students that go to school right next to the refineries are affected also by our health and psychologically because if we live there we we are breathing those the polluted air and so it's affecting our health. And then we also tend to worry about our estate and our families because we're all surrounded by it. And also lately there's been a lot of wildfire fires and families have been losing homes and stuff. So I think I believe that yes climate change does have a psychological effect on our mental health. And I'm trying to find ways on how we can take action. And just by doing something small can actually make a difference. So if there's any ideas that we can start maybe we can have like a group chat on Slack. And share all of - share all of our ideas on there.,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Okay. I was just thinking of this question. You know the climate change about the remedies of you know not being on the climate change. So for instance you know the usage of they are trying to you know eradicate the usage of firewood. So that to avoid you know the emission of carbon but now with these remedies. The will it cause more poverty because of the higher costs or will the effect of the remedies be even more worse than the disease themselves? So that's the question because I know that the higher costs will drive more people to poverty.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 Yeah that's that's that's a very very good question. Then whether or not solutions will outweigh the actual causes. You know would it actually be better with these solutions? I guess the best thing I have is right now I'm studying mechanical engineering and I really want to get into solar energy. Right now solar energy isn't very effective isn't very efficient. But it's increasing the efficiency and with more research it's getting better. And once it gets more efficient it becomes less expensive. So I think it just comes with time and patience and support I think is the biggest one to have.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I think we could like all benefit for the discussion because I think we all can see some kind of changes and we all want to support our community and our friends. And we could like make ideas and like maybe do like a video or something like that about it or show it around. Cause like I have thought about these small steps like these small ideas that you and things that you can change about your behavior and how you can change things. But there could be like these major things or these other options that doesn't come to like one person's mind like for example I think from my perspective someone might think something else. So I think that would be like a really good idea.,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah. Great idea Elia. I like that. So if so I think you mentioned you know having a slack channel. We actually do have a slack channel on environmental and climate change related issues. So maybe if you're interested you could. You are. Feel free to join that slack channel to continue this discussion. And Elia's idea on producing or creating a video I think is also a good one that we can all kind of we can all work together on. And maybe I'm thinking maybe we can continue discussing how we can produce such a video on our - on that slack channel. Any any thoughts about. Does that sound OK?,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah I think Elia's idea... I like it because it was very specific about you know taking this small step of using alternatives of milk and I guess if I'm not wrong Elia you wanted to also check if there are people on this meetup who'd like to collaborate with you on that specific project. Even though like we all have different ideas of how we can help our communities to mitigate against climate change. So I guess maybe getting commitment from from people about maybe doing research or contributing to Elia's idea.  You know discussing together so that you make progress towards that goal. And then I think Emily also has mentioned about the problem in in Long Beach about the oils. So maybe that could be also another strand that maybe all of you or a group of you could also work together on that. And also I think Christine and Lameck Collins you've mentioned about you know things in Mombasa and also in trying to deal with climate change.. Does it make people you know become more poor or not? So for me that's how I see like the three things. Some people can also come up with more ideas. But I think the most specific ones maybe people can just commit to that and work together make a video the way Elia has suggested at least have something that you can share with the wider group and keep improving on it. So that you can make progress until like you have a finalized project on that specific aspect. That's my suggestion. What do you think?  ,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
 I think if we make a video or something like that we can share our thoughts and like share the video to our schools and create a discussion based on the video so we can all like Emily and Christine and you guys you can like share your thoughts about ongoing issues in your places with what you deal with help and with these little helps or these images about changes could really be helpful because then you could have something to like work your arguments against or work your arguments with. So yeah that would be kind of like helpful to all of us. I think.,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 So actually Vicente mentioned about something about the solar energy and I just remembered that I got this project idea about the trapping of sunlight to be used as uh in the solar - in the solar panels. And so I thought that would be really great to link it up with Elia's project about you know also the use of firewood be you know you'll be done away with. And so I thought I can also make a video about that considering also about the usage of electricity and all that. So I think I could be a very great you know improvement in the project if we all collaborated in doing the project.  ,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
 Yeah like for example I do my video of like my project about food so I can like fit like that to the video. So I can like make some kind of like about my project. It's going to be about food. The video is going to be more things. And I can make things about food for the video. And Toivo said something about taking pictures so we could use them on video so we can all participate in it so that it could be like our video not just like my idea. But like something we can all build together and create together.,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yes I would love to do that so that we can be able to share it around our community and school. And I'm really involved in clubs and within my community. And I think creating that video will like broaden everyone's mind and they will see that not only it's affecting us here but all around the world.,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I think a video would be a good idea mostly because I think the first step to solve these problems is going to be making sure everyone knows what's going on and how we can make solutions how we can benefit from these solutions. So I think awareness is the key step in climate change make everyone aware of it and accept it. And then from there we can create solutions.  ,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yes. And if we have some  ideas then no one can say that they don't know how to make actions. They don't know how to change things. Cause there would be like proof like yeah just watch this. There's like explanations. And that's one of the reasons I joined this chorus because I want to be able to give people explanations and what they can do. Like directions not only say that yeah climate change is true but like say how it affects us and what can we do about it. So the video would be like sort of point. Like it would be something we can share together.,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah wonderful wonderful idea. So yeah. We just got we. We have to we have to make the video right? I think you everyone here is on board. I I guess as a follow up I will put every if you guys are OK I will put everyone here into the environmental channel on our on on on in our slack community so that we can continue this discussion. And I was also thinking maybe I mean in making the video probably we might have a couple of common questions that everyone can answer from their own perspective. And so that there is some sort of coherence or everyone is answering the same question or a set of the same questions but from different perspectives around the world.  ,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
 Yeah like for example how can you see climate change? Or how it affects you? So you could like show pictures or stories or something like that so everyone everyone can participate. Yeah. Yeah I think this meeting is. I don't know if it's going to take a lot more time but I need to go. So it was nice to meet you. And I especially liked to know the group. So good bye.,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Great. Yeah. Great. Thank you. And yes we're just about to close. We are. Yeah. At that time. Thank you everyone for joining. I want to remind everyone to go to the meeting agenda to leave your reflections. And I will put the links for our meeting agenda once again in the chat window so that you can go to it and leave your reflections. OK thank you so much. Any final thoughts before we close out?,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

 OK. All right. So yeah it seems like we had some great ideas right? So do you guys want to I guess one might be to first is to maybe we can reiterate what our ideas were and then if we for each one if we can go round and if we have any comments or feedback or anything to contribute or ideas of how we could work together...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 That's what I was told breakout room one.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Well Ateamate is in two but alright I'm gonna go back to the other room.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 If you can join us or if Danielle can do a assign that group. All right. Enjoy. Bye bye.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Bye. All right. So. OK. So we also had Paul. Paul can you hear us?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Ah You can't you can't hear us clearly OK.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Oh you can. That's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah. So sometimes it helps...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah. Good. Good. OK. So I think yeah. So just to just to go back. I think we had some great ideas in the room. Maybe we can talk about them in more detail and also provide feedback you know some inputs and also maybe some ideas on how we can work together on some of these ideas. Right? So would anyone like to start off and kind of go deeper into their ideas?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
 I was just wondering is there any way we could like create like a slack group chat or outlook email group or something so we can all communicate our ideas? Is that possible?,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah I think that would be great. So we can definitely create a Slack channel. Right. With we can create a Slack channel with the folks in this in this breakout room and that could be done after the meeting is over.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 That sounds OK? With everyone? Yeah? Nice. So let's let's definitely do that. So in terms of project ideas does anyone want to start?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
 Hi. I just wanted um like an idea that has to do with ocean pollution and how we could prevent that. I know that would also tie into climate change which are some other people's ideas. So.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
 Right. And in terms of cleaning up the ocean pollution did you have any specific approaches or ideas into that?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 Well I can't think of any off the top of my head. I know recently there was ocean cleanup. They used a certain piece of technology and I don't know how to explain it but I guess I could talk about in the group chat more for more feedback.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah yeah yeah. Any any ideas from around the room here?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Maybe just a quick question for you like why do you think that challenge exist?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 To clean up the ocean?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Well it's affecting our environment and it's kind of hard because we've been polluting the ocean for so long. So there's so much trash within the ocean. So it's hard to get all that out and people are still polluting even if they don't mean to do it directly. Some of the products are using.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Not Just trash but chemicals which.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 If you study animals how ocean animals filter the water(inaudible).,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Um my mom was talking. Did you guys hear that or no?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 (everyone makes wavering hand motions) I mean if yeah if you can If you can repeat that that would be great. Or try to summarize it.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I'll type it in the chat. Is that okay?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 My mom suggested using animals. So biomimicry how they filter out all of the toxic waste and still manage to survive. So that was her idea. So that's biomimicry and the Ocean pollution together.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
 Hm. Excellent. I think that's a great idea. Any any other?,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 So maybe we can go next.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 So I have this amazing ladies here. So what what we heard what they were thinking about was creating the solution to reduce on littering in the school. So there was an idea around making um throwing of litter into the bins fun for the kids. So this could be maybe through making the bins look like  basketball rims or something. Or maybe they light up or they sing or a song when litter goes in especially for the very young kids. So just making the whole idea of of reducing littering fun in the school. So I think that's what the girls are thinking about.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
 I I personally think that's it's a fantastic idea to always I mean incorporating play into everyday activities is it's it's always something that's helpful. I feel like and especially in and especially like you said for young kids to develop the habit of of cleaning up. And I think that's a great idea. Well any any other? Yeah. Yeah.,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
 I can add something. Marsden can can the girls can they tell us like who thought of that idea?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 It's a merge of ideas. Yep. So Petra.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Was this your idea Petra?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Tell me about it. What did you think of?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I thought sometimes when I go to the supermarket on the roads I see rubbish so I was just thinking of how to reduce that rubbish.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 OK anything else? Did anybody help you any other ladies? Do either Ashley or Ashley want to join in and tell us what they thought? Do you like that idea?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Why? Tell me one thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 What's your name? No stand up. What's your name?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 My name is Ashley Wanjeku. ,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 OK. And what did you think of her idea?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I liked it because it was helping our area and people are pleased to try and live with a clean clean area. It helps the it helps the community.,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
 OK great. OK great. And then would anybody else the other Ashley do want to join in and tell us what you think?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I like this idea because it helps people like. It helps us to stay a clean place as Ashley has said. And I also like the idea of the Basketball bin because people would like help like they would make the place clean and people wouldn't be littering.,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
 Do you think the kids would like that?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 How many kids go to your school? A lot of kids like 100 kids?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 So how are you going to set up the basketball or how are you going to set that up for everybody? That's a lot of kids to shoot in the baskets.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 I was thinking I was thinking like in every class. They have their own trashbin. And like the basketball rings should be decorated with colors. So like every time they go they dance their rubbish was (inaudible) the dust bin.  To maybe to start singing or colors to start forming around. Yeah. (inaudible) Because they learn how to recycle.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Excellent excellent leadership thinking. Very good. All right. That's. That's excellent job anybody else want to add anything from that group?,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 What's your name? What's your name?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I think that this the idea is good because it's a fun way to get the environment clean and the job done.,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
 Excellent. Thank you so much for sharing this was perfect. That's exactly what we wanted. So very nice sharing. Keep thinking. Good job.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah. Any other ideas from around the room about this idea?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I think that was a really great idea. Because me and Emily are part of key club and we usually just go to service events and you know clean up go to beach cleanups street planning but we've never thought of actually turning it into something fun. And so I thought that was like really great idea.,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Usually when we attend like beach cleanups once we're done they collect like all of the trash that we picked up and they like they weigh it so that they can have like how much like we got to clean up. And then that's something that maybe Joe can use for his like research too like conducting beach cleanups or like any like community cleanups and like measuring how much trash they picked up.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah thank you Emily. And a question. So when they weigh it. Did they give out prizes to whoever collected the most?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah. They don't. But it could be something that can like we can use to motivate like the students or the people who come out to like do the beach cleanups. It's something that they can like. Yeah. Like something that can motivate them to do it.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Maybe win like a coffee card or a Starbucks card or a treat card or something. (laughing) I'm kidding. So... New York do you does anybody else want to join in? Patrick do you have anything you want to say?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I'm back here. I just need to uh (inaudible),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Can you raise your microphone? We can't hear you.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Can you guys hear me now?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Good. Good. So I've just joined this group I was in the other group so but I've only had the last sections of of the ideas that are coming from the students. So I'm looking forward to getting to learn more about what the discussions were like because I missed out the first bit of it. I was in the other group which is also doing some good work.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Nice good to have you with us.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I am seeing actually an idea that Paul had written in the chats. Paul do you want to kind of tell us about it?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
  It said 'I have an idea of creating a software that detects the amount of carbon dioxide or carbon(inaudible). I think I guess it's carbon dioxide in the environment and suggests the best methods to //curb these bites and ads// to Internet users. And Paul I don't know if you're...,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
 Is Paul on this call?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Paul has sent a message. And he said he’s about to -,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 He's having problems. OK. All right. So that so so Paul is having some Internet connection issues right now. But so within the chat he's that's his idea. I guess we can continue around his idea in our Slack channel. And Patrick if you wouldn't mind. There's some background noise if you wouldn't mind muting your microphone. That would be awesome.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Thank you. Alright. Thank you so much. Any other ideas? So how about from our folks at uh in Long Beach?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Also like part of the like the ocean pollution. There's also like air pollution. And here in Long Beach. Like at the school that we attend to. Right behind it there's oil refineries and. Well we have the highest like air pollution here in our area because of the oil refineries. And I was wondering if anyone has like suggestions for like doing like service service events that can help reduce air pollution.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 Yeah. It's a big issue. We we're having some fires in Los Angeles right now and the air quality right now outside just out out here it's pretty bad. There's smoke everywhere. So any any thoughts on air pollution and how we can reduce them? I guess it connects directly to what Paul was mentioning right? In his in his chat.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah so hopefully like on the Slack our group chat. Hopefully I could get to talk more with Paul. And like so he can share his idea with me and then do something together.,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah. Yeah. I think that would be excellent. Any other thoughts from around the room? back? Do you have something?,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Maybe New York Joe? Meghan?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah. So I would like to link like the two ideas from Rayzon to the current problem of air pollution. So Rayzon are sort of wanting to make it fun like incentivizing kids to collect the litter. So I'm just thinking how do we provide such incentives to you know industry some organizations that you know like pollute the environment so that instead of creating barriers for them we incentivize them to try and and maybe use clean clean energy to try and you know pollute less rather than the way things are being done right now.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
 Maybe we could also find a way to replace the use of fossil fuels to more healthy um things to use instead of using fossil fuels that pollutes the air.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah. Some yeah no I agree. Yeah some great points and if we can work create some projects around those ideas I think that would be awesome and that would be really relevant to all the discussions that's going on around the world. Going back to going back to the climate discussion Right? And what's what's going on with that as well? Jennifer your idea was did could did we talk about your idea? No not yet right?,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Mine was about studying how climate change affects the topography of our planet which is the arrangement of the natural and artificial physical features of an area. So like when the glaciers melt there is a high there's a rise in sea level which may cause the water breaking down rocks and soils to rapidly grow. And like I'm gonna examine a certain area if there are any changes so far with global warming as well climate change. You know if you guys have any ideas about that,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
 Yeah. Are are you noticing any changes in Kenya? You know due to climate change?,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 I'm not sure about that yet. I need to do more research on it.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Oh yeah? Yeah my question was directed toward Marsden or I guess Zach also. Yeah you would.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I just wanted to let Marsden's students to- to try and respond to that question.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah. Yeah. Do you think there are any  do you feel that there are any effects that you feel as as the result of climate change that that's occurring in Kenya? I guess that was my question but I probably over over. I made it. Oh I've overcomplicated the question obviously. (laughs),1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 Yeah they are trying to I think that trying to understand it at their level grade five. Um (turns to students) What do you think?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 What do you think about climate change?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 The climate this mark is really cold and it's supposed to be at least sunny. So yeah because climate change cannot,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah so I think there are definitely changing weather patterns. Actually the whole year has been has been quite different. The rains delayed and now they are they should have been subsiding by now. But there is a lot of rain right now. So there's definitely a lot of change in the weather patterns. I think that's what Ashley is trying to say.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I think it's just to mention there's there's a lot of pollution that has been highlighted in the media in Kenya. A lot of pollution in the rivers. So there's a lot of there's a lot of problems with water that is not safe for drinking because there's a lot of waste from industries that is going into into the different systems the rivers that find itself maybe sometimes into the pipes that we consume in our houses. So it's a big problem. Yeah.,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Yeah yeah. How about on the East Coast there in New York or in in Pittsburgh? You guys are you guys noticing any differences?,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
 We keep noticing that it's raining more and more which we're very used to getting a lot of rain Most of the year.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Oh. wow. Any observations from New York?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I mean this summer really I mean the past summer was really really hot. I think it was more hot than it usually gets. I guess that is probably from climate change.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 It's like this it's this website that's created to explain that there's different parts of like all over the world like if you go to supersite.com it shows you the places that where in climate change and our environment is is being affected. There's one in Brooklyn called Brooklyn Creek hill site and that Superfund site is like it's founded by many people who give money towards to help environment because there's a part of Brooklyn where because of industrial revolution was very effected because of all the gas and oil spills that were in the water. So it's like Brooklyn Creek hill site. I'm not sure it's hill site Brooklyn Creek.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And I think it would be directly related to Jennifer what you're trying to do. I guess. Yeah. The type of information that's provided there. I'm not sure if it'll be directly related to topography or not but I think it will it will have some very nice data that you can take a look at. Yeah? Yeah. Awesome.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 Seung everybody has really great ideas. This is very cool.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Seung does everybody have everybody's slack or email addresses? To connect with each other?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 I think we'll create a slack channel and then invite everyone who's who was on this call here. And so I took some screenshots so that we know who is on and so that we can invite the right people on there. And so we'll do that after the meeting closes. And then and then we'll continue our discussion there. Yeah? Sound good? Awesome awesome. I know that it's now getting past lunchtime in New York and I'm sure in Kenya.
