Somehow in Kenya it's midnight but I can see someone like Salome is still spending some time just to share with us something. Salome, Kudos to you. Uhh maybe before we start, I would like to say some of the few, like guidelines to help us uhh run the meetup smoothly. Like I can see we have so many people. Then in some areas like uh Spring Valley and uh South Fayette we have many people in one room, so just in case you have other device with you, you can just turn it off so that you can use one device the way you are doing. Then maybe other people, we normally have some background noise, like uh, yeah some. So in case uh you're not talking it is always good to mute your microphone. So that could prevent that background disrupting everyone. Then on the other side there is also a chat window, where in case there is any other problem or you have any question, would like to ask while someone is presenting his or her project, always feel free OK.  I really appreciate your contribution. So maybe uhh I would like to... Though I know some people, but because of other new people like Salome and some people from South Fayette, I still don't know most of you. Then other student also don't know some of you, so maybe before we start I would like everyone to introduce him or herself, maybe tell us your name your school and in case you have any project just state the name of the project then we will come to it later okay.

Wait what? OK. Where he or she is likely uhh to commit suicide. uhh, oh I know, OK. The most common age of suicide is... In the year 2007, 17. The common age was 45 to 54. By the second year, the second age is around 85 years old or older... Lastly though, like the least common is around age from 15 to 24.
 So yeah. What are some reason for people to commit suicide? This is this part I went out and asked some people. So here's some... my result... Number one, the most common is depression number two is stress. Number three is loss or fear of loss. Number four is helplessness. Number five is believe your life is a burden to other. And my last one is isolation. So. Yeah. Uhh some suicide symptom that you might see is giving like giving things away for no reason. Uhh the change in their sleep pattern. Drinking alcohol, drug. Spending more time alone for no reason. Saying goodbye like it's the end of the world. Talking about dying. Uhh buying weapon for no reason. Uhh and also like depression and lack of energy. A way to prevent it, some ways to prevent this is by taking a day off. What you're doing and go outside and have some fun. Do something that you love to do. Listen to music play video game or watch movies. Avoid alcohol and drugs... Uhh attend some kind of support group... Umm and most likely you can play some sport, because sport is another way that you can relieve stress. I notice. Umm you can also hang out with family or friends, and the most important one is call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. So, yeah. Uhh that's my citation, and that's it. The guitar one.

And so uhh I made an obstacle course, and I programmed it using a Cozmo code lab. So. uhh... So the materials you will like I used, were uhh... First of all you need a Cozmo. Uhh I use sticky notes for the obstacle course because it's uhh really fast and it's pretty flat. And also you need a, an electronic device with the Cozmo app. That's the Cozmo lab. That's how you are able to actually program Cozmo. Other blocks that I used, uhh that I used were these. This one's forward. Turn left, turn right, and act like a winner. So uhh forward block, it's pretty straightforward, it moves Cozmo forward. Turn left block it turns Cozmo 90 degrees to the left. Turn right block is the exact same, except 90 degrees to the right. And act like a winner makes uhh Cozmo act like a winner. You'll see it in the run that I have a video for. And so, how you change how forward would you go. So this is, there will be a keypad that pops up if you click on this right here, and then it's like a keypad so if you just type however. So I, if uhh. So I just did 10 so. I just put a one and a zero. Uhh... Like what are the things needed. If you look at the uhh obstacle course, you need to move... The Cozmo would be like facing this direction. It would have to move forward.  Turn right. Uhh go down. Turn left, and then go to the finish line. And so that's. And so the program. This is the final program that I had. I have it three rotations forward, turn right, three rotations forward, turn left and uhh three rotations forward, and then acting like a winner. Uhh and then... Here is the run. It's a video. And so. So that end part, was the uhh act like a winner block. And in Cozmo code lab, there are many blocks like that. Uhh like one of them is like act like a cat. And then Cozmo say ""Meow,"" ""Meow,"" so yeah. That was uhh my project.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We have three different versions. We drilled one today, but it wasn't really that much of a success because one of the holes were too big. And... These two were ones that we kind of just did. Off... Basically because last year what we did a whole year we were just spending time just researching and researching and we never found anything. So we... This year we kind of just were like we're done. So we just... I play the flute so we kind of just used my fingerings and try to just make it. I don't know like what we thought it would be. And then we made two that way, one with bigger holes and one with just... Smaller holes. The bigger holes was the one that we thought turned out the best out of all of them which was our first one, which is the one I played for you guys before. The smaller hole one was pretty much the same thing except we haven't gotten around to actually finger all of the things and... It doesn't sound as good as... Like as I played Mary Had a Little Lamb. This one had different fingerings, and we still haven't figured it out. And then as I said, the last one that we drilled today, actually based on instructions that we found online. Except we didn't have the right size, and the one that we did drill the wrong size... It was too big. So that didn't work. Like I think you can see right there. Compared to all the other ones that one is a little big... So. Yeah. Those are the three that we had.  Any quesitons or comments?",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

136,"(inaudible) I made a video explaining. Umm how to compost and like what seasons are good to compost and like how to do it. So... (Video playing:  Hello this project is about composting my name (inaudabile) from South Fayette How you should compost. Thsi video explains to you how you should compost ).  (Video Playing:  You should composting things such as apples, bananas, umm broccoli, vegetable any unusued (inaudible). You should not be putting items such as sticky labels... Uhh coffee bag or stuff like that in your compost because it will create an insufficient soil. All of your objects will go inside this brown bin and this is how we do it at our school. Just put it in and at the end of lunch we will take everything put it into the black container. As you can see I'm walking over and I will now explain how to open up the latches. You must be very careful because you can hurt your fingers. You just have to  gently push up until it releases you. You do it to the other... You are going to open it up and it might be a little smelly. But... It's not that bad... We will then put it all in the compost bin. Currently we do not put anything in because we are currently up to date... Now after you enter... I mean put all of your vegetables and you want to close it. And although I cannot demonstrate this in the video... Umm you're supposed to uhh turn the composting bin about 10 times. But sometimes you overdo it just... It was large but .r. So after you... It's gonna go inside and it's gonna go around and around. That will obviously shuffle so the worms get the sufficient food that they need. Umm So this way... The worms are going to get food because you don't want them to die. (inaudible) All seasons are actually good to compost but there are different stages of composting... Different seasons. So in the spring, the rising temperatures help the composting gain in temperature. This means that the... When the rise in temperatures are going to help reactivate things that micro-organisms (inaudible). This will also help  (Inaudible) Summer. Summer is a good season to let your compost become warm since it gives your compost an extra boost of nutrients. The sun and the black box of the compost bin as you as you have noticed converts the sunlight's energy so it kind of like sends it into the compost so. It's warmer, it gets extra nutrients, and all another example is when in the summer many persons mow their lawns multiple times since that's what I'm going to do. (background noise) Is that they can actually mow their lawns and take the lawn clippings, and put them in the compost. This way it'll be better for the environment than it just being left here and there. Also people with allergies who are umm have seasonal allergies (inaudible) benefitted by this because we won't have to be around (inaudible). Umm... fall... the best season to start compost is fall. The leaves will help the soil get rich nutrients. So the leaves that fall down are full with (inaudible) which is great for the worms and helps their digestive system even better. Winter. In the winter the composting bin is normally dormant because of the freezing temperatures, but as long as the temperature isn't too cold the micro organisms will keep on producing although it will not be as much as it is in the cool climate because in the cool climate as you know, bacteria stays (inaudible). But like warmer areas such as summer and spring it's like spreading out more. So it they're not producing as much. During heavy snowstorms or extremely freezing weather you should put a tarp over the compost to make sure it does not get too cold. This way, the latches do hold on trees. (inaudible) They will rust and they will be not good for you. Ok. Why you should compost. Composting. You should compost because of the fertilization and it feeds soil with heavy nutrients. Fertilization and feeding the soil with healthy nutrients means that you are going to have a better more better soil that will help your (inaudible). Growth be better. It is actually... umm... Researchers have said that homemade compost is actually better than the ones  You get in stores. All natural. This also improves drainage and retains moisture. The biggest benefits are that you save money and resources. This means that you will be able to save hundreds of (inaudible) and protect the environment. This also helps improve your soil.

279,I think Benson can share part of the what's the prototype cause I think you can't have the video right now.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

291,And how are you using it to make the hanging line?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
292,"So we'll have the sensors like the touch sensor, a motor, and a pickso when you want to hang your line you just press the hatch down, to extend the information to you that will trigger the motorto hang the clothes automatically. And when there's rain, there's temperature and humidity sensor, it will send the information to the printer that will automatically hang the clothes when it's humid and starts to rain.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

307,"OK. Well the other project, I wasn't there in the other arc. Salome did it with Denis and they were doing their project about the color sensors in the light. That's the project they were presenting. Yeah. And this one is different.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

311,What was it supposed to be about?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
312,"No, this one was about ultrasonic sensors. So and we are using the only ultrasonic sensors like this to measure distance we are using and we are videoing it.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
313,"Okay. Maybe we'll have a chance to see it next time when you'll be having it ready. But for now, I would really like us to discuss about the prototype. The electric hanging line that Shukria was talking about so I'm just wondering what are the New York Science team thinking about the project.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
314,Can you hear me?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
315,"Shukria would you mind? I think muting your microphone, there's some background noise from your microphone. You might wanna mute it. Okay. Thank you. So as I was asking the thoughts of the New York Science team on Shukria's project.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
316,"I think, like can she, wait actually is Benson making it? Or is um",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
317,"Can she explain a little more on like what she is exactly going to do, because I'm not like I think it's a really cool project, but I just want to have a little more information.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
318,"Okay. Shukria. Can you give more information on the project? Because Yifan might be interested, but she does need a little more information.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
319,"So basically the project, as I told you, is about making an automated hanging lane. So we are using an EVT robot using the Lego Mindstorm. So we are programing it using a Lego Mindstorm app. so you code it and send the information to the print. There are some sensors, for example a temp sensor, a temperature and humidity sensor. So when you're inside the house and you want to go and hang your clothes automatically outside you just sounds press the temp sensor to  send the information to the brickthat will  trigger the motor. That is not the whole setup, just to automatically hang the clothes outside and when that is when the atmosphere is humid and it wants to rain, the temperature and humidity sensor would send the information to the brick that will again trigger the motor without you necessarily being there, and it would automatically hang the clothes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
320,"Oh, so basically, based on the weather, it will automatically decide whether or not to hang the clothes?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
321,"Yeah. It will automatically decide whether to hang the clothes, but the initial stage that you want to go hang clothes you either want to press the touch sensor that will be placed as a switch inside the house.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
322,"Oh, that's a really cool idea.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
323,And it's very helpful as well.,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
324,"Wait, so question, so the like the sensors will automatically have them hanged or like have them taken down?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
325,Both I think she said.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
326,"Not, not the sensors will- the sensors are not the ones to perform the action of automatically hanging the clothes outside but the sensors will be connected to a motor and a brick. So the sensor will just send the information to the brick and the brick will trigger the motor so that it's can automatically hang the clothes. But it's not actually the sensor that performs the action. The sensor just sends the information to the brick and then the brick will perform the action of hanging the clothes.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
327,So the sensor is just going to read whether it's wet or dry?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
328,"Yeah. When it's about to rain, we'll use a temperature and humidity sensor. So when it's about to rain, it just sends the information to the brick. I'll make the prototype and then I'll share.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
329,"Like, which sensor are you gonna use?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
330,"We're using a touch sensor, temperature and humidity sensor. Yeah. Basically those are the two senses. Maybe an improvement. Yeah",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
331,Wait the Lego Mindstorm has a sensor like that?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
332,Yeah. The Lego Mindstorm does have the sensor. A full kit has the sensors.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
333,So you’re programing in Lego Mindstorm to basically program the sensor to accept information and then give off more information about whether or not to hang the clothes.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
334,OK. So who are you working with Shukria?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

337,"Oh, yeah. I was just thinking, like what like suggestions I can give because I think it's a really good idea but because, like, I don't really, like, do you want to know anything? Like, is there anything that you want us to kind of like tell you or discuss, because I don't really know what type of suggestions to give. I think it's a really good idea though. It'd be really cool to see the actual project.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
338,"With that project you're doing, how many bricks are you going to have? Are you going to do a data chain? Or are you going to have two or three bricks or are you just gonna use one brick with a bunch of sensors?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
339,So I'm going to only use one brick and a medium motor. Medium sized motor. You know there are three types of motor in the Lego Mindstorm kit.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
340,"The large, small, and medium. So I'm going to the medium sized mortar and only one.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
341,"OK. And would you, would you need like, the rest of the team to help you maybe somewhere, maybe you have a question, maybe you felt you found some difficulties, a way trying to come up with the idea.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
342,"I would really appreciate collaboration. Maybe to tell me more about what improvement I should make in the project. Yeah. Yeah, basically the improvements that you can make on the project. Maybe some more sensors that you can add to make the project to be more successful.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

344,Yeah. I'll share in the next meet-up,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

347,"Okay, that's great. Yeah, I would, I personally would be eager to see that and I would be eager for the success of the electric hanging light. and Yeah, I know the rest of the team will be successful. Actually, I'm seeing Yifan is very much interested in that issue and maybe if she sees what you are doing she would want to collaborate. Yeah. So maybe you might you might want to keep her communicating with her in case you get stuck along the way, you can ask her to chip in and help you.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

352,"So basically the today's meeting meetup was for to see the progress of our Lego Mindstorm project. So if I got it right, I know right now we have a script. There's a video going to be in place today. Right, Arvind? You are going to shoot the video today?",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
353,I think that's what he said,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
354,"Yeah. So I think so far, so far, so good with the project. You have the video from MPESA foundation. Will you need anything else from MPESA foundation? Maybe contribution in anything?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
355,"Well, we got one of the one of the videos, which is the color sensor one which I'm pretty sure you guys used the light sensor for that one. Well, we were wondering if it's possible if we can get like at least two clips like of different types of projects that you guys could do, because we've got you've provided us with the color sensor, which is good enough. We like that. But I was thinking if it was possible if we could have like another video. Any project, anything is fine if possible. More ideas that are more at least projects done even if it's a prototype, it doesn't really matter. As long as it follows the curriculum or the course it does, then everything should be fine. But yeah another video.",1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
356,"Okay. Mhmm. So MPESA team would you be able to share another video? Yeah, I know you people are doing a lot of robotics. So. Shukria, Salome, and Benson, the both Salomes, is there any other video that you people can share to Arvind so that he may include it in the final video?",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

358,"I also just had one more comment, so I know, like, they're working with Lego Mindstorm and I learned before from Jason that it's kind of drag and drop kind of like coding. So I don't know if um the people from Kenya used this as well but in like at least in the United States, like in a lot of schools like, in the United States, yeah, they use something called Scratch. I don't know if you guys have heard of it. It's a kind of a coding program produced by M.I.T. students and it's targeted for people to learn programming easier because it's not too complicated where you have to come up with everything. They give you code and it's also kind of, I guess, kind of like Lego Mindstorm where you drag and drop so I think that's something like if you guys want to like kind of experiment with, that's also a fun, but not too hardcore.",1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
359,"Yeah, I get your point, Yifan, I've rarely interacted with Scratch. I don't know. There's a time we had a meetup on Scratch I don't know if Shukria, but I am sure if Salome and Benson, both Salomes you are not but Shukria did you? The one with Spring Valley? Have you ever been in a meet up with Spring Valley?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
360,I don't remember being in a meetup with her.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
361,What about the MPESA team?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
362,I don't think so.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
363,"Okay, so then have you ever heard of Scratch?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
364,"As for me, not yet, but I'm assuming I will learn more about it.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
365,"Well, maybe you should go and check it. It's not very hard. It's just a drag and drop, sort of making some robots. So maybe you do want to. It's just Scratch, just type scratch.com and then you'll get to the site and start experimenting.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
366,"I'll send the link to the group chat if you guys want to check it out. It's a, it's a pretty, I guess, fun and interactive web site.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
367,Yeah. The link is there so you can click it and maybe try practicing that.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
368,"Also, I'll say that Scratch is like block based coding.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
369,And uh Lego Mindstorms app actually uses block based coding in fact and Scratch is like if you want to get more advanced into coding you could go to Scratch. There's several projects that have been done with scratch. You can make a game.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
370,Yeah you can make games.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
371,"Or you can use hardware like there's hardware (inaudible) connected to your computer and then you can use that. Certain third party hardware will be recognized by Scratch so that you can use it. It's usually created for making things but I've seen people use like this piece of hardware called Mickey Mickey and you could connect that to your computer. You should be able to have a, like the Sprite is what they call it, which is the cat.So it's just like block based coding. It's similar to Lego Mindstorm one except this one you can get a little bit more advanced.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
372,Yeah. That's where kind of my idea came from to because when Jason mentioned block base coding I was like Scratch was another one that I knew about so maybe you guys would be interested.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
373,"Also, I have a question for the MPESA students with that humidity sensor that you're using is that a third party humidity sensor? Because I remember that like the Lego Mindstorms only provides very few sensors with them, one of them like being the gyro sensor (inaudible) and the (inaudible) sensor.So then I went on my other Macbook right here to find out like humidity sensors and I know that it's probably a third party, but I was wondering which exact humidity sensor are you guys using? If you have the answer to it.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

375,"Shukria can you hear us? Well, I think Shukria is finding some connection issues and problems. I don't know Salome would you be knowing what kind of a humidity sensor she's using?",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
376,"No, I'm not. But I'll try and help her and doing much tomake the prototype better.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
377,"Well, maybe Arvind whenever she finds her connection back she'll get to you if you're OK with that. OK, so. So this is an issue of one more video. Maybe, Benson, you should get the video that you're supposed to share during this meetup and send it to Arvind. Right?",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
378,"Yeah. And please do so in maybe shortest time possible. Because the last time the video took so long, it was very difficult for the project to continue being created. Right? So, Shukria, it's fine. We noticed that your network was a bit of a problem, but don't try- I think she's gone. So Benson, is a Mr. Ron or Saras around?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
379,"Okay. Maybe I should I should tell Mr. Ron so that it may not take long to be sent, because the last time I think Davis forgot to tell the teacher and so it really took a lot of time to send it.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

382,"So, but we really need another video. The one that you sent I really appreciate but you need another video to have it in the project. So if you may help them get it and send it?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
383,"Yes. Actually, what we need. (cross talk) We opened up a common drive for IC4 that is shared for the teachers and the students. So I'm going to show them so that they share the videos and they were actually in the same folder together with you.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Usually well when I was but I usually do it when I used to edit on ic4 like I'd be well and have like another B-roll after that instead of cutting back I must be very back down to her to her profile Maybe You can be a b-role and add to her profile that you're something good like doing like me in the future, be like You have her profile and b-roll and different B-roll like that, so string the b-rolls together more often, I guess, more often I guess. Yeah because you're just cutting back and forth which is just like it gets a bit like noxious, I guess.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It covered the topics pretty fast and it was hard to take all this in cause it goes over different concepts a little bit too fast.

It went a bit fast as well, but I do understand because you have like a...I understand that you guys have a four-minute, five minute limit on your videos, cause from personal experience, so so what you could do then, instead of like, I'm not sure if this has been done before, but you can make a part-one, video part 2 video and part 2 can go more in-depth into it. And part one has more of a general aspect, general information of optical illusions, but if you just like, just like not go too much into details, yeah or give them like reference links if they want to understand more about optical illusion and stuff.

584,"Okay. So, as I told you, I yeah, I was working on one of the Sustainable Development Goals that is clean water and sanitation. So, other than that, uh I was just looking for some of the creative ways in which uh, we can use to enhance clean water and uh good sanitation, apart from the government's initiated methods. So, other than that, I was about to explain how we can purify water and we have several ways in which you can use to purify water. We can boil, we can use chlorine and other chemicals. So, I had an interesting uh method. You can also use the UV rays to purify water, and uh according to research, it is one of the best way of purifying water because according to statistics, it is stated that it kills almost ninety-nine point ninety-nine percent of their micro-organisms, but as for me, I want to prove that it is the best way, so, with that, I want to maybe do some...go to the lab test and uh test, if, up, we refine water with the UV rays, it is the best way of refining water, I want to prove to people that uh it is the best way, I want to prove if it kills almost 99 percent of micro-organisms, that water we drink because if you can see that, now a days, many people are suffering with these kind of diseases like cholera and uh maleria, which are bad diseases. So, as for me I just had that now under. I also posted that question for you to help me in answering that question. I think you look at it later.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

589,"Ok. Uh Apart from the the government-initiated methods that the government is using to enhance clean water and sanitation, what are the other creative ways which we can use, because we can see that creativity is one of the 21st century skills. So, what are some of the other creative ways that we can use to maybe deal with this uh issue of clean water and sanitation? So that was my question.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
590,"Okay. Well, for me this is the first time I've heard of you UV rays. But I think it's a brilliant idea.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
591,You come up with it? That's great.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
592,"So, uh the idea, I got it from a magazine. I read it from a magazine and I decided to go deeper and explain how it works. So, you consider the UV rays a form of killing the DNA, so killing the DNA, prevents the organism from reproducing. So, I'll go ahead and explain more when I prepare a Sway or a video. I am not yet through with that...that project, so, when I get through, I think... uh I'll explain more and more. Yeah.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
593,"Okay. An Interesting idea...to share that an interesting idea is that... the um...do you know how the antibiotics, when like when people abuse antibiotics, sometimes there are bacteria that grow resistant to it is...you might want to look into if possible for some bacteria you become resistant to the UV rays of treatment. That's something if you want to look at as well. Okay, alright. So, like does anyone have an answer to um Christine's question that she mentioned earlier? Um, that's a pretty tough question. Scientists have been dealing with it for a long time. I was just asking if anyone else could answer your question. To add something to answer your question.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
594,"Some of it is add to that. Um, it's not my idea. It's something that's actually in use right now. I live in Las Vegas and our local water source is from Lake Mead and we have to treat that water before we can use it. So, we have a wastewater treatment plant here outside of town where they actually use ozone purify the water because ozone actually kills viruses and 100 percent of all bacteria and fungus. It's not cheap but it's a very effective way at purifying water that's actually in use and I think that could be something you could talk about as well, uh with your research and one thing I would like to ask is how cost effective is the UV radiation for purifying water and how can you apply UV radiation in that scale? I know they make UV whites. Like, I have a UV lamp here for my lizard, but which is just a giant scale version of that or is there another way to apply UV radiation to the water? Is my question.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
595,"Okay cool. That's also a pretty valid point cost effectiveness of actually treating the water itself. So yeah Christine like when you're doing more of your research, you might want to find out whether it's actually cost effective to use UV to treat water.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
596,Food. How about the group from from NYSci. Do you guys have a comment?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

598,I mean it doesn't have to be...like what you think about the idea. Do you think it's like a...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
599,Oh I didn't really. Yeah I think it's really interesting. I've never heard about UV rays stuff like that and I think it'd be informative for a lot of people.,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

601,Yeah. I'd learn a lot.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
602,"Like both of you can help each other out. They anyone not having other comments? OK. So, I think this meeting has been pretty good so far. Oh. we all talked about it things as anything anyone wants to mention before we start closing off? (pause). No?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
603,"Well, Lameck, were you going to talk about.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

606,"Okay. My project was...uh, about technology project, but let me share about the one I'm doing currently in the process is about trapping of sunlight and is an idea that just came up in the mind because how to make work easier because the sun's energy it can be used in so many ways. It can, you know, help in the same way you find water and also, you know, heating whereby, you know, can be used as...I don't know how to explain it, really, but uh. So, maybe I get back to you after I'm done with that research exactly, but now let me share about what I understand well. It's about anti-gravity. So, the idea was you know gravity, how to, you know, reduce the gravity itself and to be free from gravity and uh. So, we have...let me see, an anti-gravity so. we love, love low gravity capacities of gravity on a large scale. It's an idea that came up in my mind of how to make work easier using...how to raise boulders, you know, raising boulders is much harder when you have gravity. So, I found out a way on how to reduce gravity and you can raise the boulders. Heavy, heavy, heavy materials to higher ground so I want to learn the gravity, human brain, and uh, everything about using a magnet. Those are my projects.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
607,"Alright, that sounds pretty cool. But that's a lot too. Must keep you busy. Yeah um...Could you elaborate monitoring like antigravity thing is like a machine or is it like a concept or something?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
608,"Not really like a machine, but rather, it's a setup, this setup can reduce gravity so that I say that it's called the antigravity. So you create like a UFO, unidentified flying object. So, yeah. So that UFO can reduce gravity and uh so that region that you have the setup can...",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

615,"I was saying, starting from glass you know basic things of getting into you can start from using a glass. Aluminum foil, and you know and steel and copper coins. So, we have this setup, you will find out that they set up the job get it using the glass aluminum foil the copper coins and bedsheets, it you start to know the will be looked at it and then did so start using that concept, it can the quantity will allow that each anti-gravity so region that is not up to now be in the act to do so the region will be free of gravity and that gets the job. So that's just the basic concept about anti-gravity, so using this concept can get a region gravity. Whereby, uh, I only know this goes but I wish to create that larger region of about 1 kilometer free of gravity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

624,Oh. Okay. (mumbling) Also I think he mentioned earlier that like when lifting heavy objects he wants to reduce the work needed to like reduce the objects. That's why he wants to reduce gravity. He doesn't have a prototype. He's working on it. And why do you need to use materials. And how would you make the inside anti-gravity? I think he's still researching it and his own prototype.,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

626,Why do you need those materials?,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
627,Really. That's the problem. It is in the Sway. So let me just show you. I'll answer your questions right there. He can just continue.,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
628,"You know, as you're talking Lameck, I'm wondering if maybe somebody here um in one of the other sites might you do a mini prototype of what you're saying, like a quick video for you to incorporate into your project your project. You're saying that's very simple materials, right?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
629,I made a prototype in the video you can see.,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

631,Can you? Do you have the materials? Wait...,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
632,"Right now. What makes you think that inspires you right now? Well, I mean like he said you can use household items. I'm assuming you have most of them home. I didn't know you could build like some kind of gravity machine with household items. I think that's really interesting.",1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
633,"You know, this is the introductory part that's introduced about so I use gravity to introduce about gravity first, so that you not just really get the concept itself. Then, now, uh out of the links you can learn more about gravity from the things that are here that you can see. That now, now this the antigravity part (laugh) Yeah so, the objective...the objective here, so, the antigravity was just an idea of creating here that is free from the force of gravity. So, that's all about antigravity then uh it was discovered by uh genetic illusion, Podkletnov, he is a Russian physicist, then uh... It also been accepted by the NASA. And now, as you know these are the materials that you need and their functions. So, as you can see there is one glass which is best to hold the larger coin and the phone. You also need a phone to the larger coin. So, those two copper coins; one; will be out of the bottle outside of the glass, the other one will be inside the glass; so it's just like know, then, kitchen foil, that is the me then uh that's just job the microwave in a way that is produced by the vibrations, then uh the sticky tape that's what holds the glass together will be conducted, then a phone, the phone now, you keep it inside the glass, so inside so the glass will be, the you know uh just the pressure itself, will be conducted to use the microwave energy; so, next you put everything, you put which after you know, the kitchen foil will you know, like wrap it around the glass, so when you wrap it around the glass, now, you put them at, you test them. Look at this procedure yes, its see, uh so you stick the small pennies, uh the pennies, more pennies, now piece of paper in the glass the larger point in the glass on the phone, You put pressure on you know, uh not the other way round so, the impression model so that you can reduce the with chemical energy, then you wrap the entire glass with kitchen foil. Then, uh now, you make a point-stick and wrap around the top of the bedsheets to connect, then just place on the ground outside, so, when the spread the bedsheets around the glass, you spread them equal distances them equal distances, then you pay them the, you know, then start to dip, then uh place it outside. Then the phone, that is that the glass you hold it that can be you in it. Then they break. Then after some time, you'll see the glass rising.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

650,"Before you start on your one kilometer project I should probably start on a smaller scale like try making them try making like a smaller version of it and I'm like show it to us as well. We'll do you like the people at NYSCI try to build one. Once you have your set up and instructions, maybe you then you can post instructions like the materials so that people at NYSCI can make one of their own, right? That way you can check out if you like rises in different heights in different places. And that might be something interesting to explore as well. And once you get a prototype done so you can get other people involved to make it as well. Okay. cool.

And you say you want humans that will fly, in a way, like birds. My question is if you're in the air, how would you create the momentum to be able to move while experiencing this anti-gravity? What would You be able to move stuff over this one kilometer, hypothetically, or do you need more research on that? That's my question.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

You see now, antigravity concept, as I said on the uses of the importance one of them is the ability to three months to fly, so that's important, so that one I was saying that going another setup, but not the not the one that is shared, so, maybe when I'm done that the other setup, so, I just shared it with you, and now you'll see where the it does so humans the ability for months to fly comes up altogether.

So we'll first wait for them to finish their presentation before you have questions or even suggestions to them and help them with their class project. So I'll hand it over to, I think it was to Denis, to start us off.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

849,"Yeah, this is mine. So I think I'm doing something about eating habits cause of course it's different here in Finland than it's in anywhere else and... Let's see if I can do this. Yeah, and I think I'm doing this for health like the major seven groups of food because there are so many things that are so differently than it was before. So, yeah, I think I'm comparing the Finnish ones to USA and if someone wants to do it with me, then I'll be glad to take it to you in mind also. And all the chains, I think I'm focusing naturally on the milk about Finland, cause that's been something we've taught since we're rookies that we need to drink it. And that's not to case. You don't mean to drink milk to you just need to get things that you get from milk. And there are so many alternatives nowadays. And I think I like to see where that work is going and what kind of other foods have changed. Yeah, I think I have one video about it's this milk commercial and I like to use it in my presentation probably. Yeah. Yeah. There it is. Food is something that I think shows greatly what climate change can do to something that we need to deal with every day like we need to eat and climate change changes that so many ways that I once find out that different kinds of changes even more than I have already found. So, yeah, there are like things that I need to do in this person's case. And as you can see and the major one is using English because it's so used to me like mix English and Finnish together. So yeah, I need to focus on staying in English and doing this project with someone else would actually help me a lot because then I'd have to be explaining it as well.

So I have a question not just to Elia, but to everyone on the call. Because this project is about climate change. Why does it matter to use alternatives of milk? How does that relate to climate change? So this is a question to all of us, not specifically to Elia, but Elia, you're most welcome to to contribute too. Thank you.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

863,"No I believe that if climate change is affecting the milk and the things we eat... Well, yeah. It's something that we're gonna eat and it's going to affect our health. So we need to take action in order to reduce how climate change is affecting the things we eat.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
864,"I believe that a lot of it has to do with dependency of cows and dairy farms. When cows are killed or they're consumed, they release a lot of carbon emission. So if we use alternatives, that can sort of get rid of the dependency of milk. So the necessity of that wouldn't be as important.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
865,"Yeah, I think that's something that we as people can do, like we can't control everything, but we can control our actions and not drinking milk or using dairy is just something that. Well, it's I don't say it's easy, but it's easier than doing something very big. But it's still make -- It still makes a difference. So I think that's why drinking alternative versions to milk would be important. And then it can like go.. Oh, you can like share your cause and you can like meet other people who are vegas or are vegetarians or just interested about climate change or nature. So that's always important too.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

867,"Yeah. So I was thinking about apart from milk, was uh, I thought of milk being something probably... I don't know if it's advisable to take milk during colder climate or warm, so I just thinking about if it's cold, we can have warm milk, right? It guess warm then cold during warm times. It's advisable to take cold milk probably in the morning or in the afternoons. Then apart from milk, we can probably use a type of protein food like potatoes would be advisable too. And something in like..",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

870,"Then during warm seasons, you take cold milk. Why is it? So why should we consider that?",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
871,"Okay. Considering that milk is a protein, so protein is probably also will tend to reduce the dehydration during the warm climate. So during the warm climate, having cold milk, maybe you make mashed potatoes. So that's why I think potatoes would be a very good alternative. If you can't take milk, because I understand that some people are probably taking cold milk in the morning kind of, you know, not fitting their health. So I thought of taking mashed potatoes, maybe breakfast then in the evening. Probably not even dinner. You can have it before the dinner. The main meal. So that's I thought potatoes and milk kind of go hand in hand.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
872,"OK. Thank you. Any other person who wants to react on the question that Mr. Zach asked? Why -- Why is it important to use alternatives of milk? Collins or Christine, do you have anything to say?",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
873,"I think it's important to use the alternative for milk so that you're able to maintain  the initial.  For example, you see that some nutrients which are generated by milk (inaudible-audio cutout). So If you use the alternative, (inaudible) same as provided by the  milk.  So your body will lack -- will not lack the nutrients, which it was processing before. Using alternatives, you retain the nutrients which you are using before by getting them from the milk.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
874,"And also protein. I understand, Maybe I don't, I'm not sure. But I guess biologically during warm climate we tend to use a lot of energy compared to cold climate. So I thought having a broad alternative apart from milk, another protein food would be advisable because you know of the energy and the body building. Yeah.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

876,"...about how food can be affected because of climate change and having alternatives for milk can be very useful because of cows are where you get milk from. It can have can be negatively affected by the extreme climate changes, the weather patterns like the rise in carbon emissions, which can affect their health, which in turn makes the milk bad for you to drink. But if we have other alternative choices, we can we can still get the nutrition, nutrients we wanted. But it's gonna be from some other source where it's healthier than cows or goats or any others.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

878,"I think when carbon are emitted in the atmosphere, fastly they can interfere with the ozone, which in turn enables the sun rays to penetrate more into the atmosphere. So when they penetrate more fast into the atmosphere, they bring about desertification, which may affect some of the productivity of the land. So this might affect even the milk in the sense that there'll be no food for the cows as the production of the milk will go down.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
879,"And also for the more this indirect effect of the carbon emission, we'll see that that might cause acid rain. So the acid rain will alter the normal growth of the vegetation by which the desertification or the encroachment of the desert will enlarge. So in that case, it might cause the hot climate to, you know, it would be unfavorable for the cows to produce the milk. So that's how I think carbon emission affects climate change.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

881,"For me, again, it has a lot to do with dependency, cow breeding is a major part of the emission of greenhouse gases, and when they emit, they stay in the lower atmosphere, causing the earth to heat up and the energy balance of the earth to become unstable. And so when that happens, the like like we said, the agriculture, the climate, the environment will change drastically. And that can affect a lot of the livestock, the plants and the animals.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

889,"According to - okay Veera asked about the greenhouse gases related to cows and uh...I think there is no direct effect of the gases to the cows. Apart from inhalation, so probably most of them are indirect. That's including the carbon emission and chlorofluorocarbons and the methane, so all of them will affect the cows indirectly, but there is no immediate direct effect. Apart from inhalation of the gases. So the toxic gases which are released probably, when the ranch is near an industry, so that's when they may inhale just the same way as two humans. Then we may be affected and their production will be it will be really low. Yeah.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

891,"OK. We are trying to say that any external gas from the atmosphere does not affect the cow.  But we understand that the cow releases up to about 70 to 120 KGs of methane, which are released into the environment. They might also cause they have a negative effect to the environment. So the cow releases the methane, but now there's uh... Through the cow dung. So the cow dung, it has the methane.

893,"Yeah, actually, it's.. Every summer, it's a little bit warmer like this summer. It was I think the most was 14 degrees in Celsius. And that's a lot. And for example, the ocean, which is right in front of the city, hasn't been frozen in 10 years. And before that, it was always frozen by the time of winter. And and it seems that the snow is coming every year a little bit later. And you can really see the effects of climate change by just looking at the glaciers that are like the closest one to the cities just about 10 kilometers from the city. And it has really been just shrinking out from the city and all of the glaciers and stuff is just - if you want photos from 20 years or 10 years ago, it's really a huge change.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
894,"Yeah, you can see same kind of changes in Finland, actually. Like it's minus 7 degrees outside right now and it's unusual of this time of year. Like the winters are going to be longer, but not as cold. And there's not like there's not been as much snow as I remember in my childhood.  Like last year, the snow was - it wasn't in place that many days. And there was this like colder season came like as early, I think. But it came again, like near spring and it was actually snowing in spring. And it was quite scary, I think, cause you can actually see the changes like through your own eyes. You can actually see that, yeah, there's snow as there is not as much snow and the colder weather and there are so many like the like summers are kinda warmer I think, but they are... There's been more raining and everything like that. So I was wondering if it's the same around world. Cause like I said I can like totally agree. You get to see those kind of things.

Apart from that, their activities of your car outside the (cuts out). For example, there are times where the earth is closer to the sun. This is a vast auditorium hellion period.

899,"I think the effects are different wherever you are, like if you are in Finland, you see different kinds of effects than you see in America.

And so, for example, when usually you talk about climate change, that the effects of climate change, you think about certain areas. But overall, things are that where it's dry it's going to be drier and worse. Like uh hot, it's going to be like even warmer. So that kind of changes are like scientific facts that have been like written that, yeah, there are kinds of rules but there are not really rules. It's different from place to place. And I think that's the thing that sucks the most kinda cause you can't like you can't see five years for future. You can't see that what kind of changes are. You can just guess. And the most educated guess is the one that we are like given so we don't see that. Well, in Finland you can see kind of like the discussion, like what would be that much. You again see these. Yeah. There are like five things you need to know about climate change. You can see these professionally written articles and I think that would be like more important cause you don't know - there are too many variables to consider.

I'm looking at the chat window here, and there was a question about is there a difference between weather and climate? And Vincente had a response.

The difference between weather and climate.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
901,"Yeah. What Vicente is saying is actually the truth. But what I like to add on is that weather is normally determined day to day daily.

And in that we probably only see the movement of glacier that may cause the tension. And also, you know, the encroachment of and decertification. It might also cause, you know, the tension and anxiety and all that. Also probably global warming. And, you know, also the way that the emission of the emission of the gases, the toxic gases might really affect your brain.

And like in Finland, we probably like kind of parts of who we are is the fact that we live in Finland and we do with these kind of winter activities. That's that. That's just like part of us. So when climate change changes that and we can't go skiing or hiking or something like that in winter and we don't see snow. It can change the perception of us. And we need to rethink where we are and what kind of people we are if we are not Finnish and if we don't live here and how our culture takes the hit after climate change.

And just by doing something small can actually make a difference. So if there's any ideas that we can start, maybe we can have like a group chat on Slack. And share all of - share all of our ideas on there.",1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
913,"Okay. I was just thinking of this question. You know, the climate change, about the remedies of, you know, not being on the climate change. So, for instance, you know, the usage of they are trying to, you know, eradicate the usage of firewood. So that to avoid, you know, the emission of carbon, but now, with these remedies. The will it cause more poverty because of the higher costs or will the effect of the remedies be even more worse than the disease themselves? So that's the question, because I know that the higher costs will drive more people to poverty.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
914,"Yeah, that's that's that's a very, very good question. Then whether or not solutions will outweigh the actual causes. You know, would it actually be better with these solutions? I guess the best thing I have is right now I'm studying mechanical engineering and I really want to get into solar energy. Right now, solar energy isn't very effective, isn't very efficient. But it's increasing the efficiency and with more research, it's getting better. And once it gets more efficient, it becomes less expensive. So I think it just comes with time and patience and support, I think is the biggest one to have.",1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
915,"I think we could like all benefit for the discussion because I think we all can see some kind of changes and we all want to support our community and our friends. And we could like make ideas and like maybe do like a video or something like that about it or show it around. Cause like I have thought about these small steps, like these small ideas that you and things that you can change about your behavior and how you can change things. But there could be like these major things or these other options that doesn't come to like one person's mind, like for example, I think from my perspective, someone might think something else. So I think that would be like a really good idea.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
916,"Yeah. Great idea, Elia. I like that. So if so, I think you mentioned, you know, having a slack channel. We actually do have a slack channel on environmental and climate change related issues. So maybe if you're interested, you could. You are. Feel free to join that slack channel to continue this discussion. And Elia's idea on producing or creating a video I think is also a good one that we can all kind of we can all work together on. And maybe I'm thinking maybe we can continue discussing how we can produce such a video on our - on that slack channel. Any any thoughts about. Does that sound OK?",0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
917,"Yeah, I think Elia's idea... I like it because it was very specific about, you know, taking this small step of using alternatives of milk, and I guess if I'm not wrong, Elia, you wanted to also check if there are people on this meetup who'd like to collaborate with you on that specific project. Even though, like, we all have different ideas of how we can help our communities to mitigate against climate change. So I guess maybe getting commitment from from people about maybe doing research or contributing to Elia's idea.  You know, discussing together so that you make progress towards that goal. And then I think Emily also has mentioned about the problem in in Long Beach about the oils. So maybe that could be also another strand that maybe all of you or a group of you could also work together on that. And also, I think, Christine and Lameck, Collins, you've mentioned about, you know, things in Mombasa and also in trying to deal with climate change.. Does it make people, you know, become more poor or not? So for me, that's how I see like the three things. Some people can also come up with more ideas. But I think the most specific ones, maybe people can just commit to that and work together, make a video the way Elia has suggested at least have something that you can share with the wider group and keep improving on it. So that you can make progress until like you have a finalized project on that specific aspect. That's my suggestion. What do you think?",1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
918,"I think if we make a video or something like that, we can share our thoughts and like share the video to our schools and create a discussion based on the video so we can all like Emily and Christine and you guys, you can like share your thoughts about ongoing issues in your places with what you deal with, help and with these little helps or these images about changes could really be helpful because then you could have something to like work your arguments against or work your arguments with. So yeah, that would be kind of like helpful to all of us. I think.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
919,"So actually, Vicente mentioned about something about the solar energy, and I just remembered that I got this project idea about the trapping of sunlight to be used as uh in the solar - in the solar panels. And so I thought that would be really great to link it up with Elia's project about, you know, also the use of firewood be, you know, you'll be done away with. And so I thought I can also make a video about that, considering also about the usage of electricity and all that. So I think I could be a very great, you know, improvement in the project if we all collaborated in doing the project.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
920,"Yeah, like, for example, I do my video of like my project about food so I can like fit like that to the video. So I can like make some kind of like about my project. It's going to be about food. The video is going to be more things. And I can make things about food for the video. And Toivo said something about taking pictures so we could use them on video so we can all participate in it so that it could be like our video not just like my idea. But like something we can all build together and create together.",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
921,"Yes, I would love to do that so that we can be able to share it around our community and school. And I'm really involved in clubs and within my community. And I think creating that video will like broaden everyone's mind and they will see that not only it's affecting us here, but all around the world.",0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
922,"I think a video would be a good idea, mostly because I think the first step to solve these problems is going to be making sure everyone knows what's going on and how we can make solutions, how we can benefit from these solutions. So I think awareness is the key step in climate change, make everyone aware of it and accept it. And then from there, we can create solutions.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
923,"Yes. And if we have some  ideas, then no one can say that they don't know how to make actions. They don't know how to change things. Cause there would be like proof, like, yeah, just watch this. There's like explanations. And that's one of the reasons I joined this chorus because I want to be able to give people explanations and what they can do. Like directions not only say that, yeah, climate change is true but like say how it affects us and what can we do about it. So the video would be like sort of point. Like it would be something we can share together.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
924,"Yeah, wonderful, wonderful idea. So, yeah. We just got we. We have to we have to make the video, right? I think you everyone here is on board. I, I guess as a follow up, I will put every if you guys are OK, I will put everyone here into the environmental channel on our on on on in our slack community so that we can continue this discussion. And I was also thinking maybe I mean, in making the video, probably we might have a couple of common questions that everyone can answer from their own perspective. And so that there is some sort of coherence or everyone is answering the same question or a set of the same questions, but from different perspectives around the world.",0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
925,"Yeah, like, for example, how can you see climate change? Or how it affects you? So you could like show pictures or stories or something like that so everyone everyone can participate. Yeah. Yeah, I think this meeting is. I don't know if it's going to take a lot more time, but I need to go. So it was nice to meet you. And I especially liked to know the group.

I want to remind everyone to go to the meeting agenda to leave your reflections.
