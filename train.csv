44,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,That's a very very nice video Dennis actually I because we do come from there and life in Kadera is really really hard so you can see what people do go through I mean how difficult life is  but they do survive so if you can give your contribution about on the video okay if you are in that position what could you have done it's real that's life in Kadera now if you're in that situation what could you have done?,0,0,0,1

52,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Okay anybody to contribute I mean to comment on the video yeah because that's the life in Kadera okay what if you are the one in that position what can you do to come out of such a place or how what could you have done to at least help those people in such a place?,0,0,0,0
53,20170422,NYSCI,Gabriella,I just wanted to comment on the video I thought it was really well done and it drew attention to an actual issue and like I thought the production the way it was kind of laid out and made was really well and it really did a good job explaining what life is like there and it showed us who don't live anywhere near there it showed us what it was like a window into the world that people there like what the conditions are like how they live. I thought it was really well done and I applaud you Dennis I don't know if you can hear me though,0,1,0,1
54,20170422,IC4,Danielle,Oh looks like Dennis has lost the connection,0,0,0,0
55,20170422,NYSCI,Gabriella,Aw well when he comes back I'll tell him,0,0,0,0
56,20170422,IC4,Danielle,Yeah thank you ,0,0,0,0
57,20170422,MPESA,Ashley,About the video I think it's really great Dennis has really done good work I was actually almost crying because that was really true that is what life is like there uh people suffer and we tend to assume when we are on this other side we tend to forget what others are going through so I think that spending time with teenagers in a place  advising them on how to study that they can really work hard they can change their future and everything I think that's what you can do is just communicate and talk with them that it can get better and yeah I liked the video a lot,0,0,0,1
58,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Well that was really great presentation I like how he edited the video like he used the transitions I mean you see uh Dennis and I we do use Camtasia to edit our videos and it's been a process but not so long like 3 months we've been using the Camtasia and so far I think we've catched up so in the video making process I think we are good to go yeah,0,1,0,1
59,20170422,IC4,Dr. H,I really appreciated it as an adult and I've been to Kadera but I've never actually heard anyone any of the students to reflect on what it's like and to express it so Dennis thank you very much.,0,0,0,1
60,20170422,IC4,Danielle,And this is Daniel I just wanted to comment that what I liked about the video is that it also highlighted hope that people have to other that they have to kind of build camaraderie in the community so I appreciated seeing that too,0,0,0,1
61,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,Just in case Dennis can't I don't think he has a connection right now to hear us giving him all this awesome feedback,0,0,0,1
62,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Okay he's trying to reconnect to join the meeting but I think in due time he'll be with us but yeah we can still contribute to the video I mean comment on the video yeah well Gabby I mean Yvonne what's your say on the video,0,0,1,0
63,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,Gabby kind of said exactly what I wanted to say which is I never would have thought life is like that there and I think that I loved how the video was so descriptive of how life is there and I loved the music combined with the transitions and the text all put together it was really nice I thought and I really enjoyed it,0,1,0,1
64,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Well that's really great so I don't know if Dennis will be able to join so that he may give the final no we have a friend over here Abraham what's your say on Denis' video - oh Dennis is back! Abraham your turn,0,0,1,1
65,20170422,SAG,Abraham,I think it was amazing um I think it's just a perfect example of what life is like in Kadera and it's just fascinating congratulations Dennis,0,0,0,1
66,20170422,SAG,Denis,Thank you,0,0,0,0
67,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Dennis now such a video to bring all the pictures together to edit,0,1,0,0
68,20170422,SAG,Denis,So thank you Atemate so what motivated me on making that video  first I do live in Kadera and I know all the challenges there is all the suffering they go through and still to strive for survival so I thought maybe going around and maybe capturing some of the events and sharing with you so maybe can get some opinion and some ideas for you yeah thank you for watching my video,0,0,0,1
69,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Well Dennis that's really great so I think there's another video Yvonne you had a video to share so can you talk about it before it's shared because it's next in line Yvonne what's your video all about?,0,0,1,1
70,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,Well I think Gabby wanted to say one more thing about Dennis' video,0,0,1,0

73,20170422,NYSCI,Gabriella,It looked like a professional video yeah it was really well done and the way you added the music over it  it reminded me of like yeah professional video you could see on like yeah it was really well done,0,1,0,1
74,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,Yeah I don't know if you could hear but everyone gave such positive reviews on it  it was really well done,0,0,0,1

77,20170422,MPESA,Ashley,Uh you said that you took the photos yourself - you are a professional photographer I actually thought you took the videos from Google you can do that then that's really nice I liked it,0,1,0,1
78,20170422,SAG,Denis,Yeah are there those photos on the Google? I don't know,0,0,0,0
79,20170422,MPESA,Ashley,I'm not sure I'm not sure,0,0,0,0
80,20170422,SAG,Denis,Okay thank you but taking photos around Kadera is not that hard I ,0,0,0,0
81,20170422,MPESA,Ashley,I bet it's hard,0,0,0,0
82,20170422,SAG,Denis,No  no,0,0,0,0
83,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,Okay so just to give a little brief background on my video so it's about mushroom burials so it's a different way of being buried so that you sort of decompose through the earth and give back so you sort of come up and we sort of it's like instead of just being buried in a coffin and like rotting in the ground you can instead choose to be buried using mushrooms and I'll let the video explain for itself,1,0,0,0
84,20170422,IC4,Danielle,Alright this is Danielle I'm gonna work on sharing that video  can mushrooms eat you that's the one right? One quick thing sorry I'm gonna actually show myself really quick hi again everyone I am just observing but I wanted to introduce Rachel who is also joining us from Namibia and just wanted to introduce her and she's also just observing  Rachel did you have anything you wanted to say really quick? Oh she actually she has a lot of terrible noise in the background so maybe not but just wanted to say hello really quick and say hellon on behalf of Rachel as well as Kristina and Dr. Hamilton who are here so okay now I'm gonna go show this awesome video,0,0,1,0
85,20170422,IC4,Kristina,Hey everyone this is Kristina I'm calling from California good morning  good afternoon,0,0,0,0
86,20170422,IC4,Danielle,Cool!,0,0,0,0
87,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Well Yvonne I think that's a very  very amazing video. It's actually giving us an idea of I mean burying somebody yeah what motivated you to make such a video? Uh because yeah for me that has never come up in my mind so what motivated you to get you to make such a video?,0,0,0,1
88,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,I actually I wanted to say that it's actually more of a tribute to my colleague who no longer works here she's the one who came up with the idea and produced and directed it but I helped her with the audio and the filming of it and I wanted to share it because I thought it was a really good video that really was well put together to sort of show people about mushroom burial which I don't think is super well known,1,0,0,1
89,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,I think right now in the group it's well known hopefully everybody has been able to learn something from the mushroom burial yeah so now I'll welcome comments from other members on the video,1,0,1,0
90,20170422,SAG,Denis,So my comment about the video I think the video was nice and learning something from mushroom that not get some of the main thing but some of the points I got about the mushroom was very educative I did not know all this about mushroom but thank you for sharing that wonderful idea,1,0,0,1
91,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Dennis what was really educative from the video can you elaborate more what was educative?,0,0,0,0
92,20170422,SAG,Denis,So Atemate all those that I've seen I did not know about that mushroom so through watching the video I've learned a new thing which I didn't know I've learned a new thing,1,0,0,0
93,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Yeah so actually I think all of us have learned a new thing from the mushroom burial so just a rough question would you practice mushroom burial Dennis?,1,0,1,0
94,20170422,SAG,Denis,no no I can't,0,0,0,0
95,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Oh really?,0,0,0,0
96,20170422,SAG,Denis,Yeah I can't,0,0,0,0
97,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Why can't you practice the mushroom burial later we are here to do these things practically after learning we are here to do these things practically in our real life situations so why can't you do it,1,0,0,0
98,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Hey Dennis can you tell us why can't you do it?,0,0,0,0
99,20170422,SAG,Denis,I've never tried maybe I will try in the next meeting I'll discuss it with you,0,0,0,0
100,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Okay okay okay so any other contribution?,0,0,0,0
101,20170422,SAG,Abraham,Yeah I have a comment I think it's a good video because many of us we mostly in Kenya we know that mushroom is to be eaten it is food so at least I'm educated thank you thank you for that video,1,0,0,1
102,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Uh first of all let's welcome Rachel I think everyone can see Rachel at least you can see her face hi Rachel!,0,0,1,0
103,20170422,IC4,Rachel,Hi! Hello everybody hi,0,0,0,0
104,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Rachel you are welcome so Abraham you just said that you learned at least a different use of mushroom that's really great and I think you'll make it practical like as Dennis said he is willing to practice that so any other comment Ashley?,1,0,1,1
105,20170422,MPESA,Ashley,I think the mushroom video is really nice I actually personally I hate mushroom as food so I was thinking okay what's the use of mushroom if I can't eat it and I find it disgusting so glad it has a use and it's really unique like it prevents the soil from it maintains the soil structure I think it's really important for us to start practicing that since it's an educating process Dennis so we should just try it ,1,0,0,1
106,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,I think that was great Ashley any other thing from any member? Yeah Gabby I think Gabby you can say something then your friend she's so quiet,0,0,1,1
107,20170422,NYSCI,Gabriella,Uh yeah I just wanted to uh cause I hadn't seen this video I actually didn't get to see it when it was being produced but I was just thinking I lost my train of thought hold on I was thinking it's great because you're able to have something good come out of something bad because you know death is obviously like it's a sad thing but at least by using this method of burial something good can come out of it and it can help our planet and I thought it was very educational and I love the way it was shot and I actually want like that's inspiration because now I have an idea of that actually you could pull that off  because we use the same equipment we use the same like everything and I could actually imitate that in one of my own videos so I was just commenting that it's a really good video I think it's really inspirational I think in the future I'd like to make stuff like that - of that caliber.,1,1,0,1
108,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,Yeah I commented this in the group chat already but I just wanted to thank everyone for their really kind feedback I'll definitely pass it on to my friend who originally produced it,0,0,0,1
109,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Yeah I think Yvonne that is really wonderful but just wondering how did you come up with the video yeah the explanation is nice but I don't know how you did figure out how you came up with the bodies how did you manage that,0,1,0,1
110,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,I think we actually sort of took the images of the bodies from the internet I don't think we actually physically acted it out though it would have been cool to do so I think we showed the images more so to just show what it looks like and how it's done but the animations you saw in the video like the drawings were all done digitally.,0,1,0,0
111,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Oh Yvonne I've just seen something yeah it's so curious were you the one who was on the ground at the end of the video yeah at the ground were you the one?,0,1,0,0
112,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,I think that picture was taken off online,0,0,0,0
113,20170422,NYSCI,Gabriella,I think because it actually is a thing like the pictures that you saw it's someone that's proposing like creation and use of the suit so it's someone else that has actually actively done talks on it and has prototyped it so we kind of took that and took the information well they I assume took the information they found and made it so that it's easy to understand like if you're not necessarily a scientist you kind of understand the science behind it and so it's interesting to find out the science behind it but I don't think anyone actually put on the suit I don't know if you can get the suit but yeah it was from like the internet,1,1,0,0
114,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,The inspiration was from a Ted Talk actually which I think you can look up about mushroom burial. Now the one the image in the video with the person wearing the suit and sort of wearing a speaker around there I don't know if you remember that image but that was from a Ted Talk so I think you can look that up if you wanna learn more about mushroom burial,1,0,0,0
115,20170422,MPESA,Ashley,Let me just say for a minute I think what she meant is at the end like at the end of the video you I think you were smiling like it was just a joke showing how the mushroom thing can be done I saw something like that I think,0,1,0,0
116,20170422,NYSCI,Gabriella,I could pull up the video now and see if I can find what they're talking about do you want me,0,1,0,0
117,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,Sure,0,0,0,0
118,20170422,NYSCI,Gabriella,Yeah I'm gonna pull up the video to see what it is that we're talking about maybe we could clarify,0,1,0,0
119,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,We have a separate computer here where we can pull it up and just scroll through,0,0,0,0
120,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Rachel how about if we welcome your comments what I mean what's your take on this video how was it to you,0,0,1,0
121,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Rachel?,0,0,0,0
122,20170422,IC4,Rachel,Um yes um well for me the video was actually I learned something new because I didn't know about mushroom burial I just know you eat it you know I just knew that with mushrooms I just knew that it's something edible but I didn't know about mushroom burial so I learned something new and the video was quite nice the quality and the way it was made I just loved it so yeah,1,1,0,1
123,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Well that's great so Yvonne are you ready with the video?,0,0,0,0
124,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,Yeah I think,0,0,0,0

127,20170422,IC4,Dr. H,Yeah that's the one,0,0,0,0
128,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,Yeah that was the one I was talking about that was sort of pulled from the internet it was pulled from somebody who  the same person who did the Ted Talk where she actually acted it out and sort of modeled what it would look like to do the mushroom burial,0,1,0,0
129,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Oh so I think that's really great uh any other comments on the video?,0,0,0,1
130,20170422,IC4,Rachel,I just want to quickly say something I kind of missed the first part of the video most of it but I had just a question about mushroom burial and I was like what are they talking about like there's something called mushroom burials I just knew that you ate mushrooms but the most part of the video I missed because I had to go to the bathroom so yeah it would really be nice if you could share it so I could watch the rest of the video?,1,0,0,0
131,20170422,IC4,Dr. H,Well one thing that we can do and one thing that we need to do is on the uh on the project notebook there's a section for completed projects or completed videos and Yvonne if you can go into the OneNote and put a link to the video in there then we'll have and we need this also Dennis for your video so we'll start to build our library and people can look at them at all times and actually you know Yvonne if you want if you put a link in for your URL I'll put that in right now for you,0,0,1,0

155,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Nancy I think you had a question so if you may repeat that for us so maybe people didn't get it so if you can repeat it for us so that we may be able to react on it,0,0,1,0
156,20170422,NYSCI,Nancy,My question was do you guys celebrate Christmas or is it as popular there? In Kenya?,0,0,0,0
157,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Oh in Kenya we do celebrate Christmas but it is not that big deal to many people because most of the people tend not to afford the cost of celebrating so they do it to their best but as compared to you guys how we normally see still not that - people do celebrate it by going to church by meeting their families yeah so they take that as an opportunity to get together as families to go to church to pray together yeah so that's really what we do in Kenya,0,0,0,0
158,20170422,SAG,Denis,Then to share something to share something about what I want to say about Christmas where I'm coming from Western Kenya they normally have a certain protocol they follow during Christmas. For example in the morning people go to church families go to church then after church they prepare a meal which they share together then after some time they prepare a lunch they share together then late in the evening they go to meet their friends outside maybe in a marketplace so they interact with people and at night or let's say maybe at night they normally dance they go some people go to uh we call them where they can get music yeah they dance they enjoy themselves and we call it a day yeah,0,0,0,0
159,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Okay Ashley maybe you can share your bit of experience about Christmas Nancy was asking how is Christmas done in Kenya is it commercialized so what's your bit about Christmas,0,0,1,0
160,20170422,MPESA,Ashley,According to me and how I was raised Christmas is the time where you have fun with your family you spend time with them and in my family during that we usually have family reunion so you bring your family together so that you know each other my uncle believes if you don't do that one day you might end up marrying each other because just like that so yeah that's the time we take to reunite to talk to have fun to set objectives for the next year and we also thank God for that was the day Jesus was born yeah,0,0,0,0
161,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Well so that's really wonderful but you see so you see most of the Christmas holiday people do go to their countries but those who are in town mostly in town people minimal because people tend to reunite back at home so you find the town it's not very busy the city so yeah,0,0,0,0
162,20170422,SAG,Denis,So let me maybe ask Nancy a question not Nancy Ashley between Christmas and Easter which one do you think is the greatest is the greatest feast?,0,0,1,0
163,20170422,MPESA,Ashley,Um I think okay that's hard okay let me see um according to me I think Christmas is greater for me because this is the time that I meet with people I love but in Easter you see my cousin or my friend might be my cousin might be in school my friend might be in school or someone is outside the country it's really hard to get to know them I know you're seeing in perspective of Jesus being  Jesus being resurrecting and stuff but I think Christmas is all about getting together stop laughing ,0,0,0,0
164,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Wow so that's wonderful so let's say our tradition in Kenya and Nancy what about in New York what is the tradition I mean what is the position of Christmas holiday there,0,0,0,0
165,20170422,NYSCI,Nancy,Well in like America we like to um like celebrate Christmas because it's a time like also in Kenya we have family gatherings and it's also really close to New Year so I agree with Ashley we like to think our resolutions for next year as well and New York especially is during winter time so we think the whole snow white Christmas and like Santa yeah it's a fun time and we also have winter break so it's like yay no school,0,0,0,1
166,20170422,NYSCI,Gabriella,And just to add on I like how we found the common ground of like we celebrate and for both of us really the core of it is getting together with family and uniting and trying to make resolutions to better yourself and have a better year and even though the way we celebrate it is pretty different like ours is more commercialized with like all the presents and the gifts and presents and lights and stuff I love how for the both of us well for us no matter where we are at the core of it is uniting with family I think that's the most important part and cool that all of us share that,0,0,0,0
167,20170422,NYSCI,Nancy,Yeah I agree,0,0,0,0
168,20170422,SAG,Ateamate,Well that's so wonderful Gabby I think anybody else who has any comment on Nancy's video and if there is none there are some questions that came up if somebody took a look at the agenda so Yvonne,0,0,1,1

171,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,Okay so some of these questions are posed by a lot of people here like Danielle and Nancy and Dennis you guys asked about career goals and your inspiration and if you would have one special power what would it be does anyone want to answer that before as a last thought?,0,0,0,0
172,20170422,NYSCI,Gabriella,I mean if I had a special power I'd want like super power is that what we're talking about?,0,0,0,0

180,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,What superpower you would wanna have,0,0,0,0
181,20170422,MPESA,Ashley,Let me see I think I would like if I was to choose if I was able to  Avatar everybody knows Avatar right? He's an air bender I think I'd like that I'd like that because you get to do a lot of stuff so in that way I can actually prevent wars I can maintain I can preserve the environment using my ground and water bending I think that's what I'd like to be if I have powers,0,0,0,0
182,20170422,NYSCI,Nancy,I love that because one of the main jobs of Avatar is maintaining peace within the world and having that would be a really cool superpower,0,0,0,1
183,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,I love that we all know Avatar it's one of my favorite shows it's like my childhood. I love the idea of being able to bend the elements too oh my god. That's really cool,0,0,0,1
184,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,Does anyone else wanna share what superpower they'd wanna have and what they would do with it?,0,0,0,0
185,20170422,NYSCI,Nancy,Well other than Avatar I'd probably wanna have the power to time travel cause I think that'd be really cool to go back to early 1920s how to see like how life was like in America or other places in the world or in the future as well how is technology going to effect our lives if there is actually going to be robots or flying cars,0,0,0,0
186,20170422,NYSCI,Yvonne,And in terms of sort of answering the other questions about career goals and inspiration I don't know if I can speak for all of us here at the New York Hall of Science but my inspiration is just really sort of my passion for learning and science and the reason why I love being apart of the New York Hall of Science and being an associate producer and this project is I get to work with people who are so passionate about what they do and create videos which I love that we have this common ground on,1,0,0,0
187,20170422,NYSCI,Gabriella,I agree completely that's kind of what drives me like in terms of the grand scheme of things I think my driving inspiration is also a love of learning and discovering new things that's why I love math and science and technology cause it really shows you how the world works and why it works the way it does and I love learning about it and in terms of specific video topics just anything that I find interesting and that I like because I'll think to myself why does this happen like this why is this a thing and then I try and figure out okay is this something other people want to find out about is this something someone would like to see in a video and then researching and so forth and that's kind of how I get inspiration for like videos,1,0,0,1

336,20181109,IC4,Ish,Alright.,0,0,0,0
337,20181109,SVHS,Jake,I one question  one comment. My comment is. It was a very welldone video. Maybe so some constructive criticism is maybe have some more B-roll  because I do video production at Spring Valley High School as well. So  I make a lot of videos and B role is very important  just so we're not constantly going back to that same interview. Other than that  it was really good. Uh  and yeah backup music would've helped. Uh and the question is how many people worked on the video? How big was a group?,0,1,0,1
338,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,Oh. All right thanks for the feedback. And um so all we did like  okay so basically there was...we Had one director and we had like the person who is asking questions which was Ish  actually right?,0,1,0,0
339,20181109,IC4,Ish,I was the one who actually uh was interviewing the alumni person.,0,1,0,0
340,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,And then we had some person one-person audio. I think we have one person doing two cameras that's four people  right. And then we had editor. Yeah. I think there's like a fifth person too  who helped with camera at the end we' were doing  we were doing B roll.,0,1,0,0
341,20181109,IC4,Ish,Oh I am. Anyone else have a comment to make about the video? Yeah. I just want to add on to Jake's point like for the B-roll. Usually well when I was but I usually do it when I used to edit on ic4 like I'd be well and have like another B-roll after that instead of cutting back I must be very back down to her to her profile Maybe You can be a b-role and add to her profile that you're something good like doing like me in the future  be like You have her profile and b-roll and different B-roll like that  so string the b-rolls together more often  I guess  more often I guess. Yeah because you're just cutting back and forth which is just like it gets a bit like noxious  I guess.,0,1,0,0
342,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,Yeah. Oh Okay. I Understand.,0,0,0,0
343,20181109,IC4,Ish,Cool.So um Tenzin do you have a video? Deal with video online so I have to actually disturb it much. Are you still working on it?,0,0,1,0
344,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Well  the one I'm about to do  I'm filming tomorrow but I have a really old video.,0,1,0,0
345,20181109,IC4,Ish,Okay Yes sure.,0,0,0,0
346,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,OK. How do I screenshare?,0,0,0,0
347,20181109,IC4,Ish,On the bottom there's like a green button just go and I'll pop up oh she's on the way Tenzin.,0,0,0,0

364,20181109,NYSCI,Allison,Uh Where is it?,0,0,0,0

366,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,I also worked on that.,0,0,0,0
367,20181109,NYSCI,Allison,Oh really.,0,0,0,0
368,20181109,IC4,Ish,Cool. So  I Think Jake somehow...is Jake still on the call? Can't tell.,0,0,1,0
369,20181109,IC4,Danielle,Yes  he is.,0,0,0,0
370,20181109,IC4,Ish,He was lost my screen. Like wait  where did he go? OK. So  does anyone have a comment so far about it? How about Lameck and Christine? What did you guys think about it? Not sure you hear me or not. Lameck and Christine can you guys uh you guys have a comment about Allison's video?,0,0,1,0
371,20181109,SAG,Lameck,You think uh ... About the video. It's very nice.,0,1,0,1
372,20181109,IC4,Ish,It's nice.,0,0,0,1
373,20181109,SAG,Lameck,Yeah  I like it.,0,0,0,1
374,20181109,IC4,Ish,Okay cool.,0,0,0,0
375,20181109,IC4,Danielle,What makes it nice to you  in your opinion?,0,0,0,0
376,20181109,SAG,Lameck,I was also fooled by the optical illusions. So I learned a lot.,1,0,0,0
377,20181109,IC4,Ish,All right.,0,0,0,0
378,20181109,IC4,Danielle,Alison  I'm curious why you chose that.,0,0,1,0
379,20181109,NYSCI,Allison,Well  um 'cause I was on Instagram one day and I saw like an optical illusion  I was like wow  that's really cool. so  I like  researched like the science behind it and that's what inspired me to make the reel.,1,0,0,0
380,20181109,IC4,Ish,How about you  Jake and you have some video production experience right?,0,1,1,0
381,20181109,SVHS,Jake,Yeah. I liked the video. It was very well done  as well. Um  I'd say  it should be a little longer. It covered the topics pretty fast and it was hard to take all this in cause it goes over different concepts a little bit too fast. And It was just a little hard to keep up with the pace of the video so I think you should maybe expand on it and make another video that's longer and goes over each aspect of the illusion. And maybe go over different types of optical illusions as well.,0,1,0,1
383,20181109,IC4,Ish,Does anyone else have a comment to make?,0,0,0,0
384,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Um  I also agree  but I think Allison  um I think you did a good job though like trying to make it concise in a way. And I was also on set as a director and the lighting was so bad and I think it was edited well enough to make it look good  so yeah.,0,1,0,1
385,20181109,IC4,Ish,Ok  so I agree with Jake. It went a bit fast as well  but I do understand because you have like a...I understand that you guys have a four-minute  five minute limit on your videos  cause from personal experience  so so what you could do then  instead of like  I'm not sure if this has been done before  but you can make a part-one  video part 2 video and part 2 can go more in-depth into it. And part one has more of a general aspect  general information of optical illusions  but if you just like  just like not go too much into details  yeah or give them like reference links if they want to understand more about optical illusion and stuff. Okay  cool. Um  Tenzin  how's your video?,0,1,1,0
386,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,I'll share right now.,0,0,0,0

433,20181109,SAG,Christine,As for me  I enjoyed the video but I have a question. So  what do work on that machine?,1,1,0,1
434,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,What is the what? I didn't hear the middle part  sorry.,0,0,0,0
435,20181109,IC4,Ish,She's asking us to work on the machine  like what's the function of the machine?,0,0,0,0
436,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Um  basically  you sort of have an object at the beginning and it goes through a long obstacle course sort of. And at the end  the purpose of the one in the video was to hit the bell  um but a lot of other people make it to do maybe close  close a door or something. There's like a bunch of purposes that it can fulfill. You should try one.,1,0,0,0
437,20181109,IC4,Ish,Okay. Do you understand more about the machine? or do you like need a little more elaboration? Great. Okay  yes. How about you  Jake?,1,0,1,0
438,20181109,SVHS,Jake,Yeah  I'd like to say because you're inviting other kids and other people to come to New York Hall of Science to partake in this  correct?,0,0,0,0
439,20181109,IC4,Ish,Yeah  I mean I was idea in video  right?,0,0,0,0
440,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Hmmm.,0,0,0,0
441,20181109,SVHS,Jake,So  I'd say in the video you might want to explain what is a Rube Goldberg machine.,0,1,0,0
442,20181109,SVHS,Jake,Because correct me if I'm wrong  but it's a machine that's overcomplicated to do a simple task  right?,1,0,0,0
443,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Hmm-mm.,0,0,0,0
444,20181109,SVHS,Jake,So  I think maybe just added at the beginning the video so it's not you have to do this one task you can do several things anyway you want. I think that would make it more broad and help like little kids understand who might not know what this is. Other than that  it was good editing  good lighting  overall good video.,0,1,0,1
445,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Thank you. Cool lizard.,0,0,0,0
446,20181109,IC4,Ish,Yeah. I'm gonna mention that too. Yes. I'm gonna casually just chilling on his shoulder.,0,0,0,0
447,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,Yeah  I was like ,0,0,0,0
448,20181109,SVHS,Jake,Yeah. This is Aries. He's a bearded dragon.,0,0,0,0
449,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Okay. Cool  cool. Cool Little lizard.,0,0,0,0
450,20181109,SVHS,Jake,Just chills.,0,0,0,0
451,20181109,IC4,Ish,So um. I Think that covers most people's project stuff. Um Lameck and Christine  do you guys have a popup-like a video. I mean have a PowerPoint or a video of some kind? It's totally fine if you don't have any. I was like wondering if you guys have anything to share today.,0,0,1,0
452,20181109,SAG,Christine,For me  I don't have a video. Mine is just a lot of explanations.,0,0,0,0
453,20181109,SAG,Christine,Oh right. in the Sway.,0,0,0,0
454,20181109,IC4,Ish,It's totally fine. It's totally fine. It's perfectly fine.,0,0,0,0
455,20181109,SAG,Lameck,It's fine.,0,0,0,0
456,20181109,SAG,Christine,Okay. Can you explain. Are you okay?,0,0,0,0
458,20181109,SAG,Christine,Okay. So  as I told you  I yeah  I was working on one of the Sustainable Development Goals that is clean water and sanitation. So  other than that  uh I was just looking for some of the creative ways in which uh  we can use to enhance clean water and uh good sanitation  apart from the government's initiated methods. So  other than that  I was about to explain how we can purify water and we have several ways in which you can use to purify water. We can boil  we can use chlorine and other chemicals. So  I had an interesting uh method. You can also use the UV rays to purify water  and uh according to research  it is one of the best way of purifying water because according to statistics  it is stated that it kills almost ninety-nine point ninety-nine percent of their micro-organisms  but as for me  I want to prove that it is the best way  so  with that  I want to maybe do some...go to the lab test and uh test  if  up  we refine water with the UV rays  it is the best way of refining water  I want to prove to people that uh it is the best way  I want to prove if it kills almost 99 percent of micro-organisms  that water we drink because if you can see that  now a days  many people are suffering with these kind of diseases like cholera and uh maleria  which are bad diseases. So  as for me I just had that now under. I also posted that question for you to help me in answering that question. I think you look at it later.,1,0,0,0
459,20181109,IC4,Ish,Alright. The other question  where did you post the question? Where did you post the question?,0,0,0,0
460,20181109,IC4,Danielle,Oh  Christine  just go ahead and ask it. Just ask it.,0,0,1,0
461,20181109,SAG,Christine,They... It's yes.,0,0,0,0
462,20181109,IC4,Danielle,It's in the agenda  Ish. It's on towards...but Christine  do you want to go ahead and just tell us what the question? What is the question? Just tell us.,0,0,1,0
463,20181109,SAG,Christine,Okay. Okay.,0,0,0,0
464,20181109,IC4,Ish,Oh  I see it.,0,0,0,0
465,20181109,SAG,Christine,Ok. Uh Apart from the the government-initiated methods that the government is using to enhance clean water and sanitation  what are the other creative ways which we can use  because we can see that creativity is one of the 21st century skills. So  what are some of the other creative ways that we can use to maybe deal with this uh issue of clean water and sanitation? So that was my question.,1,0,0,0
466,20181109,IC4,Ish,Okay. Well  for me this is the first time I've heard of you UV rays. But I think it's a brilliant idea.,1,0,0,1
467,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Yeah me too.,0,0,0,0
468,20181109,IC4,Ish,You come up with it? That's great.,0,0,0,0
469,20181109,SAG,Christine,So  uh the idea  I got it from a magazine. I read it from a magazine and I decided to go deeper and explain how it works. So  you consider the UV rays a form of killing the DNA  so killing the DNA  prevents the organism from reproducing. So  I'll go ahead and explain more when I prepare a Sway or a video. I am not yet through with that...that project  so  when I get through  I think... uh I'll explain more and more. Yeah.,1,0,0,0
470,20181109,IC4,Ish,Okay. An Interesting idea...to share that an interesting idea is that... the um...do you know how the antibiotics  when like when people abuse antibiotics  sometimes there are bacteria that grow resistant to it is...you might want to look into if possible for some bacteria you become resistant to the UV rays of treatment. That's something if you want to look at as well. Okay  alright. So  like does anyone have an answer to um Christine's question that she mentioned earlier? Um  that's a pretty tough question. Scientists have been dealing with it for a long time. I was just asking if anyone else could answer your question. To add something to answer your question.,1,0,0,0
471,20181109,SVHS,Jake,Some of it is add to that. Um  it's not my idea. It's something that's actually in use right now. I live in Las Vegas and our local water source is from Lake Mead and we have to treat that water before we can use it. So  we have a wastewater treatment plant here outside of town where they actually use ozone purify the water because ozone actually kills viruses and 100 percent of all bacteria and fungus. It's not cheap but it's a very effective way at purifying water that's actually in use and I think that could be something you could talk about as well  uh with your research and one thing I would like to ask is how cost effective is the UV radiation for purifying water and how can you apply UV radiation in that scale? I know they make UV whites. Like  I have a UV lamp here for my lizard  but which is just a giant scale version of that or is there another way to apply UV radiation to the water? Is my question.,1,0,0,0
472,20181109,IC4,Ish,Okay cool. That's also a pretty valid point cost effectiveness of actually treating the water itself. So yeah Christine like when you're doing more of your research  you might want to find out whether it's actually cost effective to use UV to treat water.,1,0,1,0
473,20181109,IC4,Ish,Food. How about the group from from NYSci. Do you guys have a comment?,0,0,1,0
474,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,I don't know that much about purifying water so I don't want to butcher anything and contribute anything that's not of any use so.,1,0,0,0
475,20181109,IC4,Ish,I mean it doesn't have to be...like what you think about the idea. Do you think it's like a...,0,0,0,0
476,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Oh I didn't really. Yeah I think it's really interesting. I've never heard about UV rays stuff like that and I think it'd be informative for a lot of people.,1,0,0,1
477,20181109,IC4,Ish,Maybe you and Christine can like collaborate. Like she can give you the research and you can make a video about  you know  UV rays. That'd be pretty cool  right?,0,1,0,1
478,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Yeah. I'd learn a lot.,0,0,0,0
479,20181109,IC4,Ish,Like both of you can help each other out. They anyone not having other comments? OK. So  I think this meeting has been pretty good so far. Oh. we all talked about it things as anything anyone wants to mention before we start closing off? No?,0,0,0,0
480,20181109,IC4,Danielle,Well  Lameck  were you going to talk about.,0,0,1,0
481,20181109,IC4,Ish,All right I'm so sorry.,0,0,0,0
482,20181109,IC4,Danielle,maybe  I think you were going to mention a project you were doing. Yes you.,0,0,1,0
483,20181109,SAG,Lameck,Okay. My project was...uh  about technology project  but let me share about the one I'm doing currently in the process is about trapping of sunlight and is an idea that just came up in the mind because how to make work easier because the sun's energy it can be used in so many ways. It can  you know  help in the same way you find water and also  you know  heating whereby  you know  can be used as...I don't know how to explain it  really  but uh. So  maybe I get back to you after I'm done with that research exactly  but now let me share about what I understand well. It's about anti-gravity. So  the idea was you know gravity  how to  you know  reduce the gravity itself and to be free from gravity and uh. So  we have...let me see  an anti-gravity so. we love  love low gravity capacities of gravity on a large scale. It's an idea that came up in my mind of how to make work easier using...how to raise boulders  you know  raising boulders is much harder when you have gravity. So  I found out a way on how to reduce gravity and you can raise the boulders. Heavy  heavy  heavy materials to higher ground so I want to learn the gravity  human brain  and uh  everything about using a magnet. Those are my projects.,1,0,0,0
484,20181109,IC4,Ish,Alright  that sounds pretty cool. But that's a lot too. Must keep you busy. Yeah um...Could you elaborate monitoring like antigravity thing is like a machine or is it like a concept or something?,1,0,0,1
485,20181109,SAG,Lameck,Not really like a machine  but rather  it's a setup  this setup can reduce gravity so that I say that it's called the antigravity. So you create like a UFO  unidentified flying object. So  yeah. So that UFO can reduce gravity and uh so that region that you have the setup can...,1,0,0,0
486,20181109,IC4,Ish,Okay  so are you still working on the setup?,1,0,0,0
487,20181109,IC4,Ish,Okay. Cool  cool  cool. So you want to get that done. That sounds pretty cool.,0,0,0,1
488,20181109,SAG,Lameck,So the setup it includes of uh simple household things,1,0,0,0
490,20181109,SAG,Lameck,Just simple household items such as  you know  glass  aluminum foil...,1,0,0,0
491,20181109,IC4,Danielle,Sorry Lameck  we didn't actually say anything but we missed a little bit of what you said you were talking about the materials. All we heard was aluminum foil...,0,0,0,0
492,20181109,IC4,Ish,Things cut off from there. I thought it was just me. 'Cause no one else was saying anything.,0,0,0,0
493,20181109,SAG,Lameck,I was saying  starting from glass you know basic things of getting into you can start from using a glass. Aluminum foil  and you know and steel and copper coins. So  we have this setup  you will find out that they set up the job get it using the glass aluminum foil the copper coins and bedsheets  it you start to know the will be looked at it and then did so start using that concept  it can the quantity will allow that each anti-gravity so region that is not up to now be in the act to do so the region will be free of gravity and that gets the job. So that's just the basic concept about anti-gravity  so using this concept can get a region gravity. Whereby  uh  I only know this goes but I wish to create that larger region of about 1 kilometer free of gravity.,1,0,0,0
494,20181109,IC4,Ish,During a mini set up already in many by my eye you can show us. I you still working on it?,0,0,0,0
495,20181109,SAG,Lameck,So for now I have a Sway. So  I'm looking for a video. It does give you some time soon. The video is coming very soon. Oh no. I shall. Yes  you do. Guys. Yeah.,0,1,0,0
496,20181109,IC4,Ish,I mean if you want you can share us the Sway.,0,0,0,0
497,20181109,SAG,Lameck,This Sway?,0,0,0,0
498,20181109,IC4,Ish,Yeah.You can like screenshare the Sway and walk us through it. That would be pretty cool.,0,0,0,0
499,20181109,SAG,Lameck,Let me just share this Sway. Just a moment.,0,0,0,0
500,20181109,IC4,Ish,Take your time. Anyone else have like a question about the gravity machine while you pull it up?,0,0,0,0
501,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,Wait. Did you see the chat?,0,0,0,0
502,20181109,IC4,Ish,The chat?,0,0,0,0
503,20181109,IC4,Danielle,The chat window. There are some questions.,0,0,0,0
504,20181109,IC4,Ish,Oh. Okay. Also I think he mentioned earlier that like when lifting heavy objects he wants to reduce the work needed to like reduce the objects. That's why he wants to reduce gravity. He doesn't have a prototype. He's working on it. And why do you need to use materials. And how would you make the inside anti-gravity? I think he's still researching it and his own prototype.,1,0,0,0
505,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,Interesting.,0,0,0,0
506,20181109,IC4,Ish,Okay. So the mic  there's a quick question about why you need to use materials.,1,0,0,0
507,20181109,IC4,Danielle,Why do you need those materials?,1,0,0,0
508,20181109,SAG,Lameck,Really. That's the problem. It is in the Sway. So let me just show you. I'll answer your questions right there. He can just continue. ,1,1,0,0
509,20181109,IC4,Danielle,You know  as you're talking Lameck  I'm wondering if maybe somebody here um in one of the other sites might you do a mini prototype of what you're saying  like a quick video for you to incorporate into your project your project. You're saying that's very simple materials  right?,0,1,0,0
510,20181109,SAG,Lameck,I made a prototype in the video you can see.,1,1,0,0
511,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,Wow that's really cool. You think I can build a prototype right now?,1,0,0,1
512,20181109,IC4,Danielle,Can you? Do you have the materials? Wait...,0,0,0,0
514,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,Right now. What makes you think that inspires you right now? Well  I mean like he said you can use household items. I'm assuming you have most of them home. I didn't know you could build like some kind of gravity machine with household items. I think that's really interesting.,1,0,0,1
515,20181109,SAG,Lameck,You know  this is the introductory part that's introduced about so I use gravity to introduce about gravity first  so that you not just really get the concept itself. Then  now  uh out of the links you can learn more about gravity from the things that are here that you can see. That now  now this the antigravity part Yeah so  the objective...the objective here  so  the antigravity was just an idea of creating here that is free from the force of gravity. So  that's all about antigravity then uh it was discovered by uh genetic illusion  Podkletnov  he is a Russian physicist  then uh... It also been accepted by the NASA. And now  as you know these are the materials that you need and their functions. So  as you can see there is one glass which is best to hold the larger coin and the phone. You also need a phone to the larger coin. So  those two copper coins; one; will be out of the bottle outside of the glass  the other one will be inside the glass; so it's just like know  then  kitchen foil  that is the me then uh that's just job the microwave in a way that is produced by the vibrations  then uh the sticky tape that's what holds the glass together will be conducted  then a phone  the phone now  you keep it inside the glass  so inside so the glass will be  the you know uh just the pressure itself  will be conducted to use the microwave energy; so  next you put everything  you put which after you know  the kitchen foil will you know  like wrap it around the glass  so when you wrap it around the glass  now  you put them at  you test them. Look at this procedure yes  its see  uh so you stick the small pennies  uh the pennies  more pennies  now piece of paper in the glass the larger point in the glass on the phone  You put pressure on you know  uh not the other way round so  the impression model so that you can reduce the with chemical energy  then you wrap the entire glass with kitchen foil. Then  uh now  you make a point-stick and wrap around the top of the bedsheets to connect  then just place on the ground outside  so  when the spread the bedsheets around the glass  you spread them equal distances them equal distances  then you pay them the  you know  then start to dip  then uh place it outside. Then the phone  that is that the glass you hold it that can be you in it. Then they break. Then after some time  you'll see the glass rising.,1,0,0,0
516,20181109,SAG,Lameck,Let me see if I can show you on Youtube. Just see if I can show you on YouTube.,0,1,0,0
517,20181109,IC4,Ish,Really interesting. I've never heard of this before.,0,0,0,1
518,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Same.,0,0,0,0
519,20181109,SAG,Lameck,Okay. Just a moment. ,0,0,0,0
520,20181109,IC4,Danielle,Ish check on the Chat window.,0,0,0,0
521,20181109,IC4,Ish,So  the guys at NySci  you should try building this as well  right?,1,0,1,0
522,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,Yeah  'cause we have a lot of materials.,0,0,0,0
523,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,Well I think I care about it like I hope like literally but like  I think are outside  right? Let's again do it outside.,0,0,0,0
524,20181109,IC4,Ish,I mean  Lameck  do have to do it outside?,0,0,0,0
525,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,Is there like any warnings?,0,0,0,0
526,20181109,IC4,Danielle,Lameck  Did you hear that? Is there do can you do it outside? Do you have to do it. Can you do it inside?,0,0,0,0
527,20181109,SAG,Lameck,Outside. But outside. Well you know  Inside the house will not be effective as much as it would be outside. That's why it's recommended it outside. I would say that better experience going to get you to.,0,0,0,0
528,20181109,IC4,Danielle,Thank you for clarifying and good question Elaine.,0,0,0,1
529,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,Welcome.,0,0,0,0
530,20181109,SAG,Lameck,Yeah  you see  so too is start rising some type.,0,0,0,0
531,20181109,NYSCI,Tenzin,It could be a ghost.,0,0,0,0
532,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,What? Oh my God.,0,0,0,0
533,20181109,SAG,Lameck,That's for them to go to but now that's from household items  but there is another setup that I need to share  but I'll share it soon  it to you now. See the display at the house. I didn't I just did this to make the poster come out clearly but. try them now Now the other way  there's another way to get that gravity now  on the larger region. As I say  be up to one kilometer  so it really needs a lot of you know it starts under you know setups. That's why  you know...really need that,1,0,0,0
534,20181109,IC4,Ish,Before you start on your one kilometer project I should probably start on a smaller scale like try making them try making like a smaller version of it and I'm like show it to us as well. We'll do you like the people at NYSCI try to build one. Once you have your set up and instructions  maybe you then you can post instructions like the materials so that people at NYSCI can make one of their own  right? That way you can check out if you like rises in different heights in different places. And that might be something interesting to explore as well. And once you get a prototype done so you can get other people involved to make it as well. Okay. cool. Does anyone else have any ideas or questions about the anti-gravity machine?,1,0,0,0
535,20181109,NYSCI,Elaine,I agree with what Ish said. It looks like you would like labs where these kind of experiments is always better to do like a small scale because you waste of time.,1,0,0,0
536,20181109,IC4,Ish,Yeah. Um  Hi Zach. I do have a project something I want to talk about my question. Hi Zach.,0,0,1,0
537,20181109,IC4,Zach,I don't have any questions...just learning from you.,0,0,0,0
538,20181109,IC4,Ish,OK. Cool. So  does anyone they don't have anything else  I feel like they have any questions and he has no one mentioned before you start closing off  officially now.,0,0,0,0
539,20181109,SVHS,Jake,I have one question. Kind of a long one. Um  anitgravity because it's the force of foerces repelling each other right  to create lift off of gravity creating anti-gravity. And you say you want humans that will fly  in a way  like birds. My question is if you're in the air  how would you create the momentum to be able to move while experiencing this anti-gravity? What would You be able to move stuff over this one kilometer  hypothetically  or do you need more research on that? That's my question.,1,0,0,0
540,20181109,SAG,Lameck,OK. You see now  antigravity concept  as I said on the uses of the importance one of them is the ability to three months to fly  so that's important  so that one I was saying that going another setup  but not the not the one that is shared  so  maybe when I'm done that the other setup  so  I just shared it with you  and now you'll see where the it does so humans the ability for months to fly comes up altogether. Yeah.,1,0,0,0
541,20181109,IC4,Ish,Okay cool. Thank you for the explanation Lameck.,0,0,0,1
542,20181109,SVHS,Jake,I'm looking forward to what you come up with. I think you'll be really cool.,0,0,0,1
543,20181109,IC4,Ish,Yeah  that sounds cool I've never seen something like that before  so that sounds really interesting as well. Okay. Um. So is everyone good? Yes  Danielle?,0,0,0,1
544,20181109,IC4,Danielle,I was just going to say for reference  um I put Lameck's Sway into the agenda. So  a list of materials and whatnot is in there. It's easy for anyone to kind of take a look up and explore to create a prototype he is suggesting.,0,1,0,0
545,20181109,IC4,Ish,Okay. So um  I guess this is a good meeting guys. Okay. Well thanks for showing up. Make sure you leave  make sure you do reflections  because they are important. Okay?,0,0,0,0

566,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Thanks Stella I think we're getting a little bit of feedback from your microphone. I don't' know if you're in close proximity with someone else who's connected so it would be really important that when you're not speaking to make sure you mute your microphone,0,0,0,0
567,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Alright and Jessica do you want to introduce yourself?,0,0,1,0
568,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Well sure well hi everyone I'm Jessica as you can probably see I'm from Finland and I don't know what to say honestly well I love fashion and I like to listen to Michael Jackson I don't know and I like Pikachu as you can see so yeah I don't know what else to say so,0,0,0,0
569,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Perfect. That's great. Okay everyone I know we just did some brief introductions and again just know to mute yourself when you're not speaking but at the same time I want you to speak because the goal is not for me to be talking to you the goal is for you to exchange with each other so what we'll do today is we're going to watch some video projects and if you have any video projects to contribute you can go ahead and put that into the agenda or put it in the group chat and then I'm gonna bring it up and we'll watch it together. And so I know that there are some videos that New York Hall of Science has done and so we'll get started on that so we'll watch it together and just kind of share your thoughts on the video and any questions that you might have and then I know there are some questions also that you want to ask to your fellow participants feel free to put it into the group chat or into the meeting agenda so that way we can have an exchange together okay so first I'm going to go ahead and start off with showing a video project that we have from New York Hall of Science I think I'm gonna show I see that Gabby you have a link in here so I'm gonna go ahead and pull that up. Hopefully you're okay with that. Alright here we go. I'm gonna go ahead and put share this. Here we go so Gabby do you have any things you want to mention an introduction to your video?,0,0,1,0
570,20170408,NYSCI,Gabriella,Um this was a video about the Geek Street Fair a kind of um what would you call it not a marketing just a bunch of science companies like museum of natural history in Manhattan and Google and Youtube and Facebook a bunch of them all came together to form this street fair where they had like little booths showing students and parents alike various science things that they were exploring uh there was music and I got to walk around and interview people and kind of show people that didn't get to go what was going on at the street fair,0,1,0,0
571,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Excellent oh that sounds exciting okay so we're gonna go ahead and take a look at this video that you've made. If you can't hear it let me know,0,0,0,1
572,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Great that was awesome okay so what did everyone think of the video? Comments share share share. Oh wait Christine you're on mute you wanna say something go ahead,0,0,1,1
573,20170408,SAG,Christine,It was nice!,0,0,0,1
574,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Anybody else have anything Gabby that was the fair is so cool how did you find out about that?,0,0,1,0
575,20170408,NYSCI,Gabriella,Well the New York Hall of Science was going to have a booth there that they were going to show little science demos so I went there with a crew to film our booth as well as all the other booths,0,1,0,0
576,20170408,IC4,Danielle,I see when was this?,0,0,0,0
577,20170408,NYSCI,Gabriella,This was... I don't really remember when this was I'm pretty sure it was earlier this year I don't remember off the top of my head,0,0,0,0
578,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Oh very recent that's so cool. Has anybody else here on the call have you seen anything like that before a street fair about science?,0,0,0,1
579,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Was someone saying something?,0,0,0,0
580,20170408,SAG,Ateamate,Okay I think the video is really nice it's really encouraging that people are really working on science outside here it's really encouraging especially to us who are going to join the different fields of science in the university,0,1,0,1
581,20170408,IC4,Danielle,And I see there's some comments from Veera saying also the video was very nice and well done very professional what kind of video software do you use to make it?,0,1,0,1
582,20170408,NYSCI,Gabriella,Video software well we have Canon cameras we use and then we use Premier to edit it,0,1,0,0
583,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Ah and are you involved in the editing process?,0,1,0,0
584,20170408,NYSCI,Gabriella,Was I involved in the editing process no not really I usually prefer my strengths are filming or doing audio or writing or being talent editing is kind of one of my weaker spots so I'm not really involved in editing but I have been practicing so I can improve,0,1,0,0
585,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Mhm well that's awesome actually you bring up a good question I'm curious does anyone want to talk about what are your kind of strengths in video making? Kind of how like Gabby shared that her strengths are more so in the writing aspect talent I like talent cause you're on screen you're great on screen but at the same time you're also working on the editing skills how about everybody else? What are your skills in video making?,0,1,0,0
586,20170408,SAG,Ateamate,Okay uh actually I've been making videos I started making videos in the beginning of the year and I've been using Camtasia to edit maybe if I can share one let me see,0,1,0,0
587,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Yeah do you want to share a video?,0,1,1,0
588,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Oh yeah sure if you have it on your screen I've activated your share symbol,0,0,0,0
589,20170408,SAG,Ateamate,Okay I'm still searching for it then I share it,0,0,0,0
590,20170408,IC4,Danielle,While we kind of wait can anyone else speak to their video making skills?,0,1,0,0
591,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Well I can so I really like to make scripts and talk to people in videos and I also like to edit but in editing process it's long and hard so I get frustrated I want the video to be good so it takes time and sometimes it's very boring but I really like it though and it's really great to find new ways to edit things because I'm using the same program as the what was your name sorry Bec I'm using the same program I'm using the Premier as well so that's great program there are a lot of ways to edit there and well I have the thing where I'm just fed up or I think of something and then some dot comes up to my mind and I'm like this is the thing I want to make or this is the idea I want to tell people and it's just amazing I like to come up with different ideas and I also like to plan things like how do I edit this and how do I explain it and stuff like that so it's fun yeah,0,1,0,0
592,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Yeah and a lot of work too lots of hours how much time do you think it takes to put together a 4 minute video?,0,1,0,0
593,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Well it depends like if it's very educational I like to edit texts and stuff around it so it takes like a day or two maybe if I work very hard but also if I'm not and I'm very busy it takes weeks or two weeks I don't know but I also make gaming videos on Youtube so that takes like 4 hours to edit that kind of videos but it depends on video like it might take an hour it might take a week it might take a month I don't know it just about the video what do you want to say in that video and do you want to teach maybe or do you just want to make like a vlog like talking about different things like what is going on in your life and stuff like that so it depends on the video,0,1,0,0
594,20170408,IC4,Danielle,What kind of topic it's gonna be on I imagine some topics probably come easier to explain than others,0,0,0,0
595,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Like what? I'm not working on any videos right now though cause well I'm working on something but it's on my Youtube channel I have a Youtube channel so I make videos there I don't know if any of them are shareable but you can check it out if you want if you just go to Youtube and write Life Of Jessica you can find my channel and there is also a lot of Finnish videos so if you want to hear what Finnish sounds like you can go there and hear. Uh yeah so I'm working on Youtube and stuff like that it's a very small channel like I'm not a Youtuber like a million views or something like that I just make it for fun and at the same time I want to yeah English today it's very hard to talk at the same time I want to educate people about transgenders and what transgender mean and stuff like that so yeah that's pretty much my thing,0,1,0,0
596,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Appreciate you sharing! Sharing all that insight and cool that you have a Youtube channel?,0,0,0,1
597,20170408,IC4,Danielle,I said that's great that you have a Youtube channel,0,0,0,1

599,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,It's very awkward like seriously but it's fun though it's fun,0,0,0,0
600,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Well I'm glad that you enjoy it and that's good because we want people to enjoy the video making process so it's great that you're an advocate for it um and I see that we have a video that just got pulled up Atemate do you want to share it do you want to hit play? And if you want to talk to us a little bit explain and give an introduction as to what we're watching,0,1,1,1
601,20170408,SAG,Ateamate,Okay the video it's about a Geogebra there's a software a mathematics software that's called Geogebra and I used it to and that is making a bicycle using mathematics uh the mathematics concept so I used the lines  tangents  circles  and so on to make a bicycle.,1,0,0,0
602,20170408,IC4,Danielle,You're gonna make a bicycle oh let's see it,0,0,0,0
603,20170408,SAG,Ateamate,Okay here it is,0,0,0,0
604,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Oh it's playing okay,0,0,0,0
605,20170408,IC4,Danielle,I think you're muted,0,0,0,0
606,20170408,SAG,Ateamate,Oh no I've not muted it's uh yeah that was the bicycle,0,0,0,0
607,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Wow that's a great video and very cool to see how you integrated the math concepts to create that who showed you how to did you just kind of figure out how to do that or did someone show you how to do that in Geogebra?,1,1,0,1
608,20170408,SAG,Ateamate,Using this Geogebra app which I was introduced to by one of our leaders so while at school we are doing Geogebra and I thought on an application of mathematics and looking at a bicycle I saw the segments which are probably mathematics concept the tires are the circles are so on so I decided to try a bicycle and it worked.,1,0,0,0
609,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Wow that's pretty wow so you just kind of figured that out?,0,0,0,1
610,20170408,IC4,Danielle,That's pretty amazing and you managed the screen sharing pretty well so good job with that anybody else have thoughts about the video learn anything?,0,0,0,1
611,20170408,SAG,Christine,Yes I want to share my video,0,0,0,0

The cool bicycle video making a bicycle,0,0,0,0
614,20170408,NYSCI,Gabriella,Uh I really liked it I thought it was really cool I thought it was done in a way it's not just any video you'd see it's done showing you the demonstration and what I liked about it was it was showing you kind of a mathematics application and it was done in a way that was interesting and that you'd actually want to watch because I know for STEM at least when it comes to math a lot of people tend to be afraid of math or not want to deal with math because they find it difficult or like boring but this video showed an application in a way that makes you want to watch like I could see myself finding that video and like sitting and watching and thinking aw that's really cool I'd like to learn how to do that,1,1,0,1
615,20170408,IC4,Danielle,That's so great,0,0,0,0
616,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Really nice work anybody else? Want to share comments about the video?,0,0,0,0
617,20170408,IC4,Danielle,How it was made. I'm very impressed that you were able to figure how to do that on your own I probably wouldn't be able to. Very smart! Very smart. Okay so I'll go ahead and cue up Christine's video about eggshells because I had just got a copy of that too so I will do my best here to screenshot share my screen and do that. Okay Christine do you want to talk a little bit about what the video is while I bring it up? What's the talk a little bit go ahead,0,1,1,1
618,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Christine do you have anything you want to say before I hit play?,0,0,1,0
619,20170408,SAG,Christine,So... So many people have been,0,0,0,0
620,20170408,SAG,Christine,Oh my video is about an egg shell and how we should make use of it because it is useful it is used to cure much diseases such as gastric health it helps the bone marrow produce healthier blood cells and also it contains calcium that helps lower the high blood pressure that's all,1,0,0,0
621,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Appreciate that introduction and so we'll find out more from your video here I'll go ahead and hit play,0,0,0,1
622,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Alright excellent thanks Christine for sharing that. Anybody have any thoughts Christine you have any comments about how you made the video?,0,0,1,1

624,20170408,IC4,Danielle,That's awesome,0,0,0,1
625,20170408,SAG,Denis,Hi so my name is Dennis and about the video that Christine has made because people have been throwing away the egg shell and polluting the environment as a way of maybe making use of the egg shell and that's the outcome yeah,1,0,0,0
626,20170408,IC4,Danielle,That's great who did what component who did the research and who did the recording? Clearly Christine did the narration,0,1,0,0
627,20170408,SAG,Denis,Yeah the narration or Christine and even the writing and everything but for me I just commanded her to do the research,0,1,0,0
628,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Commanded yeah,0,0,0,0
629,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Who did the editing part the part that's hard very hard?,0,1,0,0
630,20170408,IC4,Danielle,So Christine who did the editing of your video to put it all together?,0,1,0,0
631,20170408,SAG,Christine,Myself,0,0,0,0
632,20170408,IC4,Danielle,You did? Excellent work excellent work! I learned a lot about egg shells. Face mask okay I never would have thought of that I like the lot of research into that. Anyone else have any feedback or comments about Christine's video?,1,0,0,1
633,20170408,NYSCI,Gabriella,Uh I like how you used voice over I don't know how to do that but I would like to incorporate it so maybe one day you could show me how to do that that was really cool,0,1,0,1
634,20170408,IC4,Danielle,That's excellent,0,0,0,1
635,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Anybody have thoughts? About the video? Learn something new?,0,0,1,0
636,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Well I learned something new or do you want? Who's first me or you?,0,0,0,0
637,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Oh go ahead!,0,0,0,0
638,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Okay so I thought the video was amazing there was good graphics  good texts  everything was perfect and I really liked the voiceover as well so there was a lot of beauty tips which were awesome I have to try them myself yeah I will feed the egg shells to my dog as well so thank you for the helpful tips and stuff like that. It's very weird that I have been like it's very fun to see that you can make a video about the thing like you are throwing the egg shells away all the time but you don't think of it as a useful item or anything like that so it's very fun to see you to make a video about a thing which you thought was piece of garbage but it wasn't like it was very awesome to see that. Thank you for sharing that video it was awesome.,0,1,0,1
639,20170408,SAG,Ateamate,I'm glad that you try it out and tell me the outcome,0,0,0,1
640,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Okay I'll make a video about it I could actually make a video about it  it's great idea. About Bec's video I really liked the science thing and it's fun to see that there are actually people who make these kind of things because in Finland you don't have these kind of things if you could go outside in Helsinki in Finland anywhere there's not these kind of events or anything and you actually talk to other people and ask a bunch of questions from them and in Finland that's weird it's very weird and it was very fun to see that things which we never would do well we do something but not in type of scale or anything like that and I would really like to interview people to my videos because it's very hard to because Finnish people don't like to share anything Like it's very weird of course there's people who like to share but they don't like to be filmed or anything like that um yeah it was very cool so yeah,0,1,0,1
641,20170408,NYSCI,Gabriella,Yeah interviewing people is hard it's always very awkward to walk up to someone and say hi can I interview you for a video it's gonna end up on Youtube also I'm very short and all the people there were a lot taller than me so that sometimes causes like camera problems that last guy I interviewed was like over 6 feet and I'm 4'11 so that was funny,0,1,0,0
642,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Okay well it was fun to see and of course I can't interview people or I could but there is so few people who would be in my interview in English because we are in Finland we speak Finnish all the time so English would be very hard to talk so I don't know,0,0,0,1
643,20170408,IC4,Danielle,In California people love talking no problem people are ready to just share out so it's interesting. Jessica you can do some interviews here get all the content you want,0,0,0,0
644,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Yeah if you pay me my ticket,0,0,0,0
645,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Ticket and everything I will be there I promise but yeah and I'm not saying Finnish are very like not talking people because they are but they are very like they are very private and they don't want to talk about private things and to me to come up as trans to other people and talk to them some people think it's weird and it's not probably that weird in California or in New York or in anywhere else because it's out there but in Finland it's not that much so yeah,0,0,0,0
646,20170408,NYSCI,Gabriella,Uh just wanted to let you know Nancy is here,0,0,0,0
647,20170408,NYSCI,Nancy,Hi I'm Nancy,0,0,0,0
648,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Hi Nancy I'm Danielle I'm over in California and I'm one of the coordinators for the program does anybody else want to do some quick introductions for Nancy? Whose joining us. Nancy you're joining us from Nysci right or New York Hall of Sceince?,0,0,1,0
649,20170408,NYSCI,Nancy,I'll introduce myself then hi I'm Nancy and I'm 17 years old and I'm currently an associate producer for Explainer TV at New York Hall of Science,0,0,0,0
650,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Thanks,0,0,0,0
651,20170408,NYSCI,Nancy,Nice to meet you all,0,0,0,1
652,20170408,IC4,Danielle,That's great nice to meet you too and we're joined by some folks from St. Aloysius in Kenya and also joined by Jessica who is in Finland. Jessica has the Pikachu on the bed there I love the Pikachu,0,0,0,1
653,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Yeah I also think that I want Pikachu tattoo on my arm or something,0,0,0,0
654,20170408,IC4,Danielle,I love it just to kind of just to catch you up to speed we've been sharing some videos and we've learned some cool things about Google Street Fair and use of egg shells and also how to draw a bicycle using math concepts in Geogebra which is pretty great and I see a question from Gabby she placed in here and I want to make sure that we ask it which is has anyone this is for everyone to answer and share have you ever made a video that you were proud of? That's a good question,0,0,0,0
655,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Yes because I think that if I'm not proud of my video I won't be sharing it of course there are videos which I thought were a great idea but in editing process I see that it's garbage or just dumb so I don't know or controversial so I'm proud of my videos but also there are lot of cringe kind of videos which I won't be sharing but yeah I like my videos I'm not like as myself but I really like them I really enjoy them and I think if you don't enjoy your videos you shouldn't make them or if you aren't enjoying making videos you shouldn't force yourself to make videos I think it should be natural and stuff like that so yeah and you can see many people in Youtube who make videos just because of the money or fame and it's very sad and I don't know that's just my opinion,0,1,0,0
656,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Thank you for sharing that I like the idea that you should make it because you enjoy it and not to attract attention or fame or money,0,0,0,1
657,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,I think that goes in life in anywhere like don't do a job if you don't want to do it or something like that like you only live once like YOLO man like seriously don't do anything that you don't like because you will regret it as you are old and I think I don't know let's go to other ones thoughts,0,0,0,0
658,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Yeah is that a universal thing everyone knows what YOLO is did that really catch on YOLO okay um I think it's you only live once right? I don't use okay great um so how about Gabby or Nancy do you want to answer your own Gabby do you want to answer your own question too  kind of tagging off of Jessica?,0,0,1,0
659,20170408,NYSCI,Gabriella,I agree with Jessica I think if you're going to make a video it should be a video that you're proud of um if I had to choose just one specific video I'd say probably you guys didn't get to see it but it's on the New York Hall of Science website we made it for Halloween it was like the science behind werewolves. Like if they're an actual thing or something that could be real and the reason I'm proud of that video in particular is it was like the first script I wrote that we actually got it all done together and it actually made it to Youtube so that was a very proud moment when I saw it was up on the site and it was being shared and liked and stuff.,0,1,0,0
660,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Did you say people wonder whether or not there are werewolves that exist or?,0,0,0,0
661,20170408,NYSCI,Gabriella,It's like if scientifically there really could be werewolves um and it's like you could see it in the video just like kind of whether or not it's a scientific possibility. And the answer is kind of surprising.,0,1,0,0
662,20170408,IC4,Danielle,You're teasing us there okay,0,0,0,0
663,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,And I would like to ask something here some some videos which I'm not proud of and I'm still uploading to Youtube they become one of my greatest videos what I think because of the people's feedback because there is some videos which I'm not proud of but when people are commenting that video and saying this inspires people and you're awesome and it's very nice that you say these things and educate people that makes me really happy and makes me like love that video I don't know so it's very surprising that I think the video is bad but everyone else loves it but yeah,0,1,0,0
664,20170408,IC4,Danielle,That's true I mean feedback from others really makes a difference which is kind of like when we're sharing videos here when we give each other feedback and you know what our thoughts are about it it's kind of like when you get positive feedback it encourages you to wanna keep making more videos. Appreciate it. How about Christine or Ismael or Stella right are you do you have any comments about videos you enjoy making or the video making process  a video you're proud of? Christine maybe you're proud of the egg shell video you just made!,0,0,1,1
665,20170408,SAG,Ateamate,As for me  as for me I can not share my video if I'm not proud of it.,0,0,0,0

673,20170408,SAG,Ateamate,I have a comment uh first of all it's to encourage each one of us before starting to think about making a video. First of all the topic that you're going to make a video on should be interesting you should be enjoying it before making the video so that whenever the product of the video comes out you'll automatically enjoy so I think it begins from the topic to the video and then to the to actually the reaction to your video because if you like your video automatically expect positive videos and that's what will come so first of all you think about the topic you love the topic then you make your video,0,1,0,0
674,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Mhm! No I think others would agree with that too you have to really enjoy it because you're going to be putting a lot of time into it you're gonna be like looking at it all the time. And then the editing part! The hard part right? ,0,0,0,1
675,20170408,IC4,Danielle,So you have to really want to be passionate about the subject I like that comment great thought to end on. Anybody else have anything else  closing thoughts you wanna share with each other?,0,0,0,1
676,20170408,SAG,Ateamate,Okay another thing Danielle,0,0,0,0

681,20170408,NYSCI,Nancy,Yeah it was really great meeting you all and I think this is a really good opportunity for kids like us to connect with other people who share the same interests as us around the world and um yeah I'm looking forward to seeing all the videos you make,0,0,0,1

690,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Okay! So let's also so um in the agenda that I had everybody open at the beginning I wanted everyone to have it up because it's really important that we write out reflections and our time together to think about it and the best time to do that is right after the meeting so that way we kind of it's kind of cool to have everyone in the document at the same time writing the reflections so I'd like for everybody to kind of open it right now and kind of look at it so toward the bottom of the agenda there is a area a chart a table where you can put in your comments and reflections about the meet-up today it'd be really important for us to do it right now. Does anybody have any issues can you all see that? If you see it can you give me a thumbs up? Can you see it? Okay Christine okay. And the link is in the chat box too if you need it so I just wanna make sure that you are  everybody's in there now can you start let's start typing. Can I see...

694,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Yeah I think I have to see who else from what other schools you're working with and um if their school is okay with other ways of communication that's really the restriction is um the different schools what their restrictions are on how to communicate,0,0,0,0
695,20170408,Otavan,Jessica,Yeah because it's very hard for me to start making videos or just think about this project because I can't talk to people so I would really like to talk to people so yeah it's very hard to make videos or do anything basically if I can't talk to people but yeah maybe we'll chat about that later on email or something I don't know,0,1,0,0
696,20170408,IC4,Danielle,Yeah hang on the call for a little bit I'm gonna give everybody a sense and we can chat we'll follow up right now actually,0,0,0,0

726,20170628,IC4,Danielle,That's excellent. That's great.,0,0,0,0
727,20170628,SAG,Eunice,Hi my name is Eunice I'm from St. Aloysius Gonzaga in Kenya. That's all.,0,0,0,0
729,20170628,SAG,Nixon,I'm Nixon and from Kenya studying at St. Aloysius Gonzaga  I'm proud to be with you guys,0,0,0,1
730,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Nice to have you. We appreciate having you join us. I'm gonna see if someone else joined us. Oh we have someone else. Oh okay we have Walter? Are you joining? Hi. Do you wanna  we were just in the middle of introducing ourselves to each other so do you wanna go ahead and share your name and where you're joining us from?,0,0,1,1
731,20170628,MPESA,Walter,Okay my name is Walter and I'm joining you from  Mpesa Foundation Academy,0,0,0,0
732,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Awesome well I'm grateful to have you here and so Walter I know you kind of missed some of the other folks who are in the room per-se but you have one of your fellow classmates Ashley and then we also have Nixon and Eunice from St. Aloysius also in Kenya  and then German who is joining us from Las Vegas so welcome. And before we kind of jump into things I wanna make sure that everyone has the agenda open because this is something we need to refer to during the meeting and also at the end of this we'll be doing reflections which is really important for us to  an important component to the session today and so just reflect on thoughts from the things that you learn  things that you enjoy  things that could be better  and all of that you would enter using the agenda. So right now if you look on the screen that I'm sharing  you'll see the agenda. If you don't  I think German I still don't know that I see your name that's added here  I see everybody else's name. But if you wanna go ahead and add your name German to this and then the link is right up here. And if someone can since I don't have access to Fuze right now if you wanna go ahead and put that into the chat box for us just to make sure. So what you'll see towards the bottom is our area for reflections and so oh look at that we already have some names pre-populated into here which is wonderful and so at the end of the session or during the session you know if it doesn't distract you from participating in the meeting  you can go ahead and start writing some of your reflections here in this bottom portion. So just put your name your school and just some of your thoughts and  if you aren't sure as to what your thoughts should be you can always look up here to the prompt which just kind of gives you some thoughts about what are things that you gained from the session and things we can do better for the meet-up in the future. Okay? So another couple points that we wanna make is,0,0,0,1
733,20170628,IC4,Dr. H,Danielle can I jump in for a quick second?,0,0,0,0
734,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Go ahead,0,0,0,0
735,20170628,IC4,Dr. H,We have Rachel and Jazorique and some students in Okahanga and they're getting a message that they're waiting to be admitted. Have you encountered that before that keeps students out?,0,0,0,0
736,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Uh I would just advise that they close out and try to reconnect,0,0,0,0
737,20170628,IC4,Dr. H,That's my suggestion. So I'll do that but we have three more that are on the sidelines waiting to come in and I apologize for interrupting so keep going,0,0,0,0
738,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh okay no that's great and so just so everybody knows the three participants that would be joining us they're gonna join us form Namibia and this would actually be their first time doing a meet-up which is pretty exciting. Next month we actually plan to have a lot of different meet-ups because Dr. Hamilton who works who oversees this project will be doing some workshops soon but you'll learn more about that in a little bit. For now we're just focused on today and a couple reminders. The goal of our session is for us to meet and share and learn from one another on any of the topics that you are gonna be sharing via the videos. Namely in areas related to the STEM fields like math  science  engineering  and technology. You all I can see are already experts at you've seen the protocol so you mute your microphone when you're not speaking to eliminate background noise but then we want you to talk that's part of the goal so you wanna make sure you unmute when you have something to say and we want you to have things to say. Keep the agenda open which I see everybody  a lot of people in the agenda which is exciting and again we're gonna do reflections after the session so we wanna make sure you have this open. And there's a chat window in Fuze also for you to access I know our folks joining us from Mpesa that has been a challenge in the past but Fuze has told me that they've now upgraded and there should be a way for you to look at the group chat box even though you're connecting from an iPad. And if you have any issues or questions or thoughts as people are maybe talking and you don't wanna interrupt you can always go to the group chat window. So those are our reminders for the session and we've done some introductions. Any questions before we get started in sharing some videos?,0,0,0,0
739,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Ah  ah? No? Okay great. Well looking to our agenda here grateful for some of the people who've put some links in. So we're gonna start with Nixon because you are our first one and it looks like you have a video. Do you want to go ahead and tell us a little bit about the video that we're gonna share today?,0,0,1,0
740,20170628,SAG,Nixon,Yeah. Yeah. My video is about the soil enrichment. So I thought about I have made various videos but this one I consider the most one simply because I just have that passion about making a video about this so that's all that I considered so you can just look at it.,1,1,0,0
741,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Excellent alright I'm gonna go ahead and pull that up and let's have a look. If you have any issues with hearing be sure to say something because while I share my monitor I'm not gonna be able to read the chat window so if something's wrong just say something. Okay. Here we go!,0,0,0,0
742,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Okay! Was everyone able to hear that okay? Could you hear the video? Anybody have any thoughts? Thank you Nixon for sharing that with us. What are some things anyone gained from the video? Thoughts,0,0,0,1
743,20170628,MPESA,Walter,Okay something I think that is very nice. Because you see our population is increasing everyday and we need also the food to increase and I think your methods of preventing soil erosion is important. Because actually the soil can enhance the production of food. And also I like the points on awareness because a great impact when it comes to soil erosion so I think the awareness point is very nice and should be applicable to the society. Especially be made aware of how soil is important and how they can prevent soil erosion. So that was so nice and I think it will help. Especially on using calcium nitrate to apprehend the soil fertility especially in our area. So that was so nice.,1,0,0,1
744,20170628,IC4,Danielle,That's a great comment. That's great feedback.,0,0,0,1
745,20170628,MPESA,Ashley,I really liked the video. I like the idea of the calcium nitrate. We usually have problems in Kenya. So I think it's a great idea to use calcium nitrate and it was a nice video. You were able to keep in touch with us. I was smiling because some things I didn't know. And yeah that was it. It was really interesting. Danielle I'd like to request  I leave the meeting so that I can send to you my video we can't access it through the Fuze.,1,0,0,1
746,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Okay sure! So Ashley I'll let you go ahead and somehow... So she's gonna go get her video but Nixon thank you for putting it together. Can I ask where would you obtain the calcium nitrate? Are there like natural substances that have that?,1,0,0,1
747,20170628,SAG,Nixon,Probably not because we are secondary we can able to maybe test it we are able to putting different chemicals to come up with it. That one is not recommended but let's say you can buy it from a local market that sort of thing so.,1,0,0,0
748,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh okay. So get it at the store. Got it. How about you German any thoughts about the video?,0,0,1,0
749,20170628,SVHS,German,No that's okay I liked the video his way to present about the problem and his solution is good. Very good.,0,1,0,1
750,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Appreciate the content. How about anybody have any thoughts about how the video was shot and the video itself? Quality of the video.,0,1,0,0
751,20170628,MPESA,Walter,I think Nixon did a good job on the background of the video but next time maybe when he's explaining something about the soil maybe he can give us some parts of the soil and the real calcium nitrate the picture so as to bring more visual understanding and also because there are different types of soil and see how it works on different types of soil. Yeah.,1,1,0,0
752,20170628,IC4,Danielle,That's a good thought Walter thank you for sharing. Nixon how do you feel about the feedback. Does that sound like good feedback maybe integrate some pictures and maybe even some actual soil,0,1,1,1
753,20170628,SAG,Nixon,Probably I would say that on the background yes say that let's say while I was making the video on the editing I thought it was not quite fun but on the pictures I brought only two but I think it so about getting the videos and editing I will say that to me I became too busy so I thought I will display my video every time putting more pictures so I decided to assume so that's what it made me do but even on edit sometimes it creates more let's say more of that so sometimes you see that your video is not perfect so I thought too many pictures would make it bad. That's all.,0,1,0,0
754,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Got it. Appreciate your honesty there but and maybe but from the suggestion it sounds like adding some might be a good thing for the future to make it even stronger make your video even stronger because you have good explanation but picture will help to add so thank you Walter for the feedback. Anybody have any other thoughts? If not I'm gonna move on to the next video. No? Alright let's go ahead and move on. I think I see somebody join us. Jean? John? How do you pronounce?,0,1,0,1

764,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Very nice. Well we welcome you and we introduce you to our team of participants here. We're just sharing videos and we're gonna go ahead and show I think we have Eunice we have a video from you next. Right? Do you wanna go ahead and describe your video for us while I que it up,0,0,1,1
765,20170628,SAG,Eunice,Yeah I had an idea of you know we have beautiful plants in the environment and there are so many things that helping them to grow. So I thought of the organic matter specifically I thought of the leaves themselves because they also contribute to the working of the plant and how they grow. So that was the whole idea about the video and yeah. More information you'll get then from the video. Enjoy.,1,0,0,0
766,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Great thank you for sharing Eunice your video! It's a good compliment actually to Nixon's video. Sorry to just chime in there.,0,0,0,1
767,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Yeah. Anybody have any thoughts about the video that Eunice just showed us. Oh Jazorique you just joined us. Hi!,0,0,0,0
768,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Okay hi guys um great to be here I guess.,0,0,0,1
769,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Do you wanna go ahead and tell us the school you're from and where you're joining us from?,0,0,0,0
770,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Okay um I'm joining from Namibia Okahandja and yeah.,0,0,0,0

772,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Oh and the school's name is J.G. van der Wath,0,0,0,0
773,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Great. And we have students who are joining us we have German from Las Vegas Nevada in the US and then we have participants we have Nixon and Eunice who are joining us from St. Aloysius Gonzaga in Kenya as well as Ashley and Walter who are joining us from Mpesa Foundation Academy yeah and so,0,0,0,0
774,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,It's great to meet all of you,0,0,0,1
775,20170628,IC4,Danielle,It's great to have you. And we were just watching a video that Eunice from St. Aloysius put together and we were just gonna did you get to watch all the video?,0,0,0,1
776,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Okay just wanna make sure I don't know at what point you came in but glad you got to see some of it. Okay so everybody that's from the video from Eunice's video.,0,0,0,0
777,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Oh sorry Danielle I thought you meant have I like should I like can you guys like show me the video. That's why I nodded and said yes,0,0,0,0
778,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh got it  got it. We just showed it and so what I might do is I'll in the agenda there's a link to it if you wanna watch it cause we already watched it but here we'll have comments on it. I think Walter were you gonna say something about the video?,0,0,1,0
779,20170628,MPESA,Walter,Yeah I liked the video. Especially because it brings out the cycle when like the leaves are used to make the and then it brings about the plant again with the leaves. So I think it is environment friendly  it is cheap  and it is affordable that kind of supplication can be nice. Especially for agriculture students like me. I know the disadvantages of inorganic fertilizers each are very unfortunate for the environment. So I think Eunice that was a great idea cause when if you use these leaves you are actually conserving the cleanness of the environment instead of burning it so that is applicable and also the video the setting was nice. I like how you moved and showed the cycle very well from all the leaves falls down and rocks how it is used again to bring up a plant. So that was great.,1,1,0,1
780,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Thank you for sharing.,0,0,0,1
781,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Eunice do you have a response to that?,0,0,1,0
782,20170628,SAG,Eunice,Thank you for that comment. I really appreciate. Yeah.,0,0,0,1
783,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Any other thoughts about it? What we just watched?,0,0,0,0
784,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Thoughts? Okay. Alright I think I'm gonna go ahead and... Well thank you so much for sharing your video with us Eunice  appreciate it.,0,0,0,1
785,20170628,SAG,Eunice,You're welcome.,0,0,0,0
786,20170628,IC4,Danielle,I think I'll go ahead and move on to then another video I think I have a link here from Ashley  so Ashley do you wanna while I bring that up do you wanna go ahead and talk a little bit about what it's about?,0,0,1,0
787,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Ashley do you wanna? Oh wait I think your screen froze.,0,0,0,0
788,20170628,MPESA,Ashley,My name is Ashley and I'm going to ,0,0,0,0
789,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Alright so while we're waiting for it looks like Ashley's video we're still waiting for them to come back on they might have had some technical difficulties in their internet connection. So while we kind of do that  I have German I have your video. So maybe I can do that. I'll show your video over. So German do you wanna talk a little bit about the video that you had made? And explain it a little bit?,0,0,1,0
790,20170628,SVHS,German,Yes well it's Pythagorean theorem it's like how do you use this theorem in the life like construction and all ways.,1,0,0,0
791,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Got it okay Pythagorean theorem. We got some math happening now! That's cool alright. So I'm gonna go ahead and share. If anybody has any issues hearing just go ahead and say something out loud because when I screen share I can't see the box. Here we go.,1,0,0,0
792,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Sorry! Sound just kept going there. Cool well German thank you for sharing your lesson on the Pythagorean theorem and using it to deteremine another length that's unknown. Did anybody... Any comments on that on the video? Were you able to see it okay? Yeah. Thoughts or maybe things gained  something that you already knew?,1,0,0,1
793,20170628,SAG,Nixon,So about your video German  I thought let's say if I were you were handwriting I was struggling to see it so I recommend you using something like another pen or let's say if you have a brush on Microsoft office so that you can record on the screen but I struggled to see your handwriting you had neat work but I was struggling to see handwriting but that idea was great even in our curriculum we study that but so I think it can help me do better in my math. Thanks.,0,1,0,0
794,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Good feedback you liked the idea and also a recommendation to,0,0,0,1
795,20170628,SVHS,German,It's a good idea and I appreciate it and thank you,0,0,0,1
796,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Eunice did you have something you wanted to say?,0,0,1,0
797,20170628,SAG,Eunice,Yeah Israel that was a very nice video to share and a video nice idea I never thought of search that you can use a real life experience to explain a mathematical concept like Pythagoras theorem what I think for you to improve your video I think at least you should have used something like the white board to make it more visualized as people can see it clearly like using the paper because as Nixon said some of us we were struggling to see the handwritings and um yeah your work was well organized and yeah!,0,1,0,1
798,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Mhm.,0,0,0,0
799,20170628,IC4,Danielle,And German thank you for that for putting that together.,0,0,0,1
800,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Is there something. Is it something you can write in the chat box? Okay great. But German thank you for and also I'm gonna agree with Eunice too I like the world the real application of explaining it you put that problem first rather cause most people usually explain probably what the theorem is but you kind of gave us some context to here's something we wanna try out let's figure out how we're gonna do that by using this. So  appreciated that.,1,0,0,1
801,20170628,SVHS,German,Thank you  you're welcome.,0,0,0,0
802,20170628,IC4,Danielle,So we have a comment saying that at one point the video referenced root oh root 21... You meant to say root 21,1,0,0,0
803,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Got it. Okay great! Good comment. Okay well I'm trying to see if Ashley and Walter are able to rejoin us because Ashley has a video too that also looks like it's a math sharing video but while we're waiting Jazorique did you have anything you wanted to share with us?,0,0,1,1
804,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Excuse me?,0,0,0,0
805,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Huh?,0,0,0,0
806,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,I said excuse me,0,0,0,0
807,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh I was curious if you had anything you wanted to share with us. Or maybe we can move on to a question or a project that you're working on that you wanted to share,0,0,0,0
808,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Yeah I just wanted to know like how should I call it like I usually follow the tech world so like what do you guys think about the one plus five that was just released and then what do you guys also think about the rumors that the tech geeks are spectating on what the note 8 would then be like what type of specs the note 8 would have and the display and all that.,1,0,0,0
809,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Huh. Interesting question. Well could you describe the first part of your question again. Are you talking about like a device specifically?,0,0,0,0
810,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Um yeah I was talking about a phone actually a phone. Then if you could we could discuss the Samsung note 8,1,0,0,0
811,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh okay. So your curious about what are people's thoughts about the Samsung 8 that's coming out  first of all is everyone aware of the Samsung 8 that's coming out?,1,0,0,0
812,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Sorry Danielle just to rephrase to correct your question you should include note 8 because when you say that when you say the Samsung 8 it means like most people take that as the Galaxy 8 the Galaxy s8 which has already been released so.,1,0,0,0
813,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Got it. I'm curious if the rest of the group though is familiar with devices that are coming out. Specifically the Samsung note 8 that you're referring to. So German  Eunice  or Nixon? Are you familiar with the device that's coming out?,1,0,1,0
814,20170628,SAG,Eunice,Personally no. I've not heard of that,0,0,0,0
815,20170628,IC4,Danielle,That's okay. Oh well maybe you could describe a couple of the features that makes it unique why you're interested in it. To kind of inform us,1,0,0,0
816,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Okay yeah so they are spectating that the Samsung note 8 would be the first Samsung device to actually ship with duel cameras that is like a full RGB camera and then a monochrome camera which is black and white and then the monochrome camera would actually or the senor actually enables the photo or the camera to zoom in two times without losing quality in the image so it then actual improves image quality if I could say that.,1,0,0,0
817,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh okay so that's like the big feature of the device that's coming out?,1,0,0,0
818,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Yes yes that's the only that's the main thing which I am looking forward to see if they really can include that,0,0,0,0
819,20170628,IC4,Danielle,And what would you say is the difference between the Samsung note 8 is that more so a device that you can use like a pen with right?,1,0,0,0
820,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Yeah the Samsung note 8 is more like a tablet it's a cross over between a phone and a tablet it also has a Stylus so you can draw on quick notes while the galaxy s8 is more like the average person type of phone,1,0,0,0
821,20170628,IC4,Danielle,average person type of phone. Okay so we have the galaxy 8 which is eh you know it's just a phone and then the Galaxy note 8 or I'm sorry the Samsung note 8 which you're referring to which is which in your opinion is more superior is that what you're saying?,1,0,0,0
822,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Usually the specs are kind of similar in most of the ways but I wouldn't say that the Galaxy s8 is just like a blah phone but you know the phone is really good and one thing I like that the Galaxy 8 came out with is the infinity display which is like an 18 to 9 ratio not 18 to 9 it means like the phone has 95% screen and then 5% bezzle which means the bezzles are really small and then both the Galaxy s8 and Galaxy s8 plus both now ship with the edges so there's no more having the flat one and then having the edge.,1,0,0,0
823,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh interesting. Interesting. I'll admit I'm not very familiar with the Samsung devices  phones or the note so I apologize so you were informing us I think it sounds like everyone we were not very familiar with it? So you're really the one bringing to the table giving us information about it. And when is it gonna be released? You said it's not out yet right the note 8?,1,0,0,0
824,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,Yes it's not out yet but I'm not sure when the note 8 would will be released yes I'm not sure about that.,1,0,0,0
825,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh okay. So it's still on the  it's kind of like iPhones we don't know when that's being released either. The newest ones.,1,0,0,0
827,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Okay cool. Anybody have any thoughts,0,0,0,0
828,20170628,JGVW,Jazorique,It's all ,0,0,0,0
829,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh look at that there's an image of the Galaxy note 8 that we're talking about here. Very cool. Well thank you. Anybody have thoughts about it? I haven't heard of this phone before or this device before so I learned about it just now! Anybody else learn about it? Yeah alright cool.,0,0,0,1
830,20170628,MPESA,Ashley,I'm sorry? I lost connection to the internet but I'm shocked like what I'm hearing about the Samsung note 8 it's really nice I'm also not familiar with Samsung devices but wow the way you're describing it I think it will be fabulous.,1,0,0,0
831,20170628,IC4,Danielle,If you can get ahold of it  right? It's always that interesting supply and demand and how are people gonna when it comes out everyone gets excited about it and they run out. Well I know what device you want and you're looking forward to seeing! Cool! Since we have Ashley and Walter back - oh Zach has a good comment. It will be interesting to explore the mathematical features of the phone when it comes out. I like that! Connecting it back to our topics of STEM here. Cool. Alright I wanna go ahead and squeeze in  Ashley I pulled up your video so I can go ahead and show that if you wanna just set it up really quick and talk a little bit about what the video is about.,1,0,1,1
832,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Ashley would you be able to set up your video?,0,0,0,0
833,20170628,MPESA,Ashley,Um no it's really hard that's why I sent it to you,0,0,0,0
834,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh okay great do you just wanna explain what it's about while I pull it up?,0,0,0,0
835,20170628,MPESA,Ashley,Okay so the video is about surface area of a frustum cone the topic that we've been doing for a while in my class and for a while I had a challenge in the step so I missed it in the cards we had last week but I revised the subject and I understood the topic so we started Walter and we came up with the video  he's the one who explained to me the steps I was missing,1,0,0,0
836,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh wow!,0,0,0,0
837,20170628,MPESA,Ashley,So I'm sharing it so that you also learn about the of a cone,1,0,0,0
838,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Thank you! Alright I'll go ahead and play it. If anybody has any sound issues just say something out loud so I can hear because I won't be able to see you right now. Here we go!,0,0,0,0
839,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Wow! That was a lot of mathematical concepts right there. Yeah look at that tag teaming between Ashley and Walter there we go. Alright anybody have thoughts. Takeaways? Wow okay learning about how to calculate surface area that was some complicated work you guys put together thank you for explaining! How about you German do you have thoughts since your video was kind of related in a way. You did like one aspect of that ,1,0,1,1
840,20170628,SVHS,German,Yeah it's an excellent job. It's a good video. There were many many concepts and that's good. Really  really good.,1,0,0,1
841,20170628,MPESA,Ashley,So were you able to understand. Did you understand or it was too much?,0,0,0,0
842,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Thoughts? Did everyone understand it?,0,0,0,0
843,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Ah I see Eunice smiling! Oh is that cause of the question? I'll agree on my end it was very fast but if you're paying attention and you're really like focused on it  it clicks but it was a little fast I think. Oh Zach had a question on what is pi. I see some smiles!,0,1,0,0
844,20170628,MPESA,Walter,Okay pi is concept that is 3.142 over ,1,0,0,0
845,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Good explanation of it. I appreciate that. And where does the number come from? Okay.,1,0,0,1
846,20170628,MPESA,Ashley,The number twenty-two over seven. Okay. So I was taught like I was in second grade or something I was taught about pi so I've grown up knowing that pi is twenty-two over seven or 3.142 so you use 22 over 7 when the number is divisible by 7 and you use 3.142 when the number is not divisible by 7 and it's a formula which you use to get the area of circles and whoever invented it knows why,1,0,0,0
847,20170628,IC4,Danielle,That's great. That's wonderful. I like how Ashley is like I've known this since second grade I like that you've known it for a while it's just like stored information in your mind. Appreciate that. Great well I appreciate the um I know we're coming actually believe it or not we're coming toward the end of our time together and I see another comment here from Dr. Hamilton great video technical suggestion maybe Ashley comes back at the end and I would use dot instead of x to avoid x notation avoid slash for fraction because sometimes that confuses numerator and denominator. Hm. Good feedback too. Yeah I think a lot of the videos that we have showcased we can tweak them a little bit more and it'd be great I'd like to get to a point where all the videos will be in one place and we can refer to them together and have like a database of videos we can exchange and learn from and refer to when we need to. Yeah. Alright let's see I do wanna make sure that we have a moment to go back to the agenda and make sure that we let's see what else we have here. I'm looking at some questions here. Oh Nixon had a question for us to discuss to which is should animals be used for scientific or commercial testing? Oh and then Ashley had a good question too in terms of biology and science why do you think a chicken scratches itself during hot seasons or hot weather? That's great! Oh and then Walter  these are great questions! Maybe we'll choose one of them and Walter's question is  is the advancing technology being a threat to humankind? Hmm. Let's can we choose one of the questions to just like talk as a closing? What of the three would you all wanna tackle from the questions you posed to each other?,0,1,0,1
848,20170628,SAG,Eunice,For me the question on the hen. I'm very much interested in getting the ,0,0,0,0
849,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Okay so we wanna tackle okay we have a vote for Ashley's question right why do you think a chicken scratches itself during hot seasons or hot weather. Is that the one? Yeah okay. Well cause you're voting for it what are your thoughts about that,1,0,0,0
850,20170628,SAG,Eunice,Uh... I think that  that's a matter of a physics concept that's a topic that I think from one it I can relate to why birds flap their wings. So why the hens scratch their feathers is to release the heat so that they can be what is it  I've lost the word but it's just about the radiation you can bet the idea from why but,1,0,0,0
851,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Okay physics.,0,0,0,0
852,20170628,MPESA,Ashley,Someone else? William what do you think?,0,0,1,0
853,20170628,MPESA,Walter,To be honest I have no idea  I have no idea why a chicken even scratches itself,0,0,0,0
854,20170628,SAG,Nixon,Maybe to add on Eunice about it's taught in curriculum in Kenya in physics during hot seasons  during lots of hot seasons birds in the air normally flap their wings to introduce air protects to prevent the bird to losing too much that to the environment so it relates to why hens scratch their feathers because the pockets that they have introduced in their feathers let's say that they want to lose them so they can acquire moisture to their body so that at least the temperature can be minimal so that's why they scratch to remove the air pockets yeah,1,0,0,0
855,20170628,MPESA,Ashley,Okay. Ramirez?,0,0,1,0
856,20170628,IC4,Danielle,German they're asking you what's your thoughts,0,0,1,0
857,20170628,SVHS,German,Well like all the videos but I like especially about math because I love math and I have a good teacher and he teach also consider the math but I think as well it's not about  I would think everything is important about science and technology about environment I think ,1,0,0,0
858,20170628,IC4,Danielle,German that's a good reflection on the meeting but we're curious about why do you think a chicken scratches itself I'm gonna vote with the whole air pockets releasing the air pockets to be cooler  that's a really good explanation. I've never learned that in school either so I'm one of those who doesn't know either the real answer. Ashley what's the answer can you reveal it to us?,1,0,1,1
859,20170628,MPESA,Ashley,So on Thursday we had open day in our school and as we were taking our guests through the school and we went to the farm I was one of the tour guides so this girl who asked she's stationed in the farm so she asked us why do you think chickens scratch themselves so everyone was like because they are dirty I guess so they're scratching off the dirt or something so she said that was wrong answer the whole week I've been asking people in school why do they think and they say the same thing somewhat saying the physics concept some are saying the dirty and stuff but the lady told us that chicken blood is so light so that when it's really hot their blood expands so it gets uncomfortable for them so they scratch themselves due to being uncomfortable yes.,1,0,0,0
860,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Oh that's interesting! Wow. Expanding blood they become uncomfortable and they scratch themselves,1,0,0,1
861,20170628,IC4,Danielle,Ooh! Okay! That is definitely an interesting fact to learn. Appreciate that. Yeah I would I'm with you Eunice I would not have thought of that we needed someone to kind of shed light on that. I love it. Mind boggling. Very cool. Okay well appreciate your time that we've had together and I wanna make sure to encourage us to go back to the agenda and write reflections and again if you need thoughts about what we need to right,0,0,0,1

Then again I would like to appreciate you because the last meeting that we had  Alison shared with us about the health and food though she needed to go into that but today I can see she has gone farther and has prepared a great Sway to share with us. And I can see that's a good work.,1,0,1,1
882,20171030,SVHS,Alison,Awesome. Yeah I'm really excited to share what I have.,0,0,0,0

884,20171030,SVHS,Israel,"Yeah regarding Marianna I'm glad you mentioned it. She was here two minutes ago and then she received a phone call. I hope everything is fine I didn't even ask her. I will though. She needed to leave right away. So hopefully everything's fine. I'll find out. She seemed a little problem like  ""I gotta get going."" But she'll be able to present that natural disaster next time we meet globally. So if you guys don't mind we can put it on pending mode so that way we can present it. Okay?",0,0,0,0
885,20171030,SAG,Denis,Okay. I really appreciate.,0,0,0,1

And today I can see they have done it. And that's really great. Thank you a lot.,0,1,0,1
890,20171030,SVHS,Israel,You're welcome,0,0,0,0
891,20171030,SAG,Denis,Then again in case your students have any question I think that link  they are able to toward the end of the meet-up you can be able to discuss your question. Hi Zach. Hello. Zach?,0,0,1,0
893,20171030,SVHS,Israel,Hi Zach how are you? Israel at Students Create in Nevada. How are you?,0,0,0,0
894,20171030,IC4,Zach,I am good. Happy to see you all. How are you?,0,0,0,1
895,20171030,SVHS,Israel,We're doing okay Zach. Looking forward to collaborate with all of you guys there.,0,0,0,1
896,20171030,IC4,Zach,Great. Great. Great.,0,0,0,0
897,20171030,SAG,Denis,Zach may you kindly turn on your video so may you turn on your video so the student from Spring Valley and also Israel can see you. Your face. (inaudible) our pleasure to have you in the meeting. Thank you a lot Zach. And I hope you will be with us from the beginning until the end. I think we are going to continue and other people maybe they will get us on the way. And before we start the meetup I would like to say some of the guidelines when you follow. For example  we'll be having so many people on the screen and I suggest that when you are not talking please turn off your microphone  and when you want to speak you want to share your idea  please turn it on  so that it can prevent that background noise. Background noise actually the sound from the environment that come in the conversation. Then again there's a chat window there. It's open when you look at your screen 'cause you are using the Desktop. So in the chat window you can post any question in case you have any issue  maybe the internet connection  or you want to ask any question when the person is talking. You can post it there. Then any comment about what the person is saying or what the person is sharing is there. Then again at the end of the meetup be able to call the website  the reflection website  where you are expected to at least fill your opinion  your comments concerning the meetup. What do you think went wrong  what did you think they went well  what was your opinion  what did you learn from the meetup  what's your takeaway. So you are expected to write that on reflection. I hope when you have all that we'll be able to move there smoothly. Again when we start we normally do the introduction and I have done already with you. You are Jake and Alison. Zach is also there. And there's no need  and in case other people will come in  then they'll be  I'll actually request them to introduce themselves so that you get to know them. From there I will go direct to sharing the video or you can just say hi. Just say hi to Kristina  Zach. Then after that we will be moving to sharing the video.,0,0,0,1
898,20171030,SAG,Denis,So maybe before we share the video  I would like to start by sharing the Sway by Alison which was about the food and health. And before I share the Sway  I would like to kindly request Alison to just tell us briefly about your Sway  then after that just briefly about the Sway  then I will display the Sway and share the screen  then in the process you'll go ahead and share more about what you are  what you have prepared. Okay? So please briefly tell us more about your Sway.,1,0,1,0
899,20171030,SVHS,Alison,Okay so my Sway presentation is talking about the relationship between the standard American diet or the western diet and the epidemic of disease that we are facing today. Like obesity  heart disease  cardiovascular disease  and all these other diseases that are caused from health. And I will be trying to answers some questions in the presentation on how to solve this issue and epidemic.,1,0,0,0
900,20171030,SAG,Denis,Thank you a lot. I would like to welcome Atemate to the meeting. Atemate please say hi to the other people.,0,0,1,0
901,20171030,SAG,Ateamate,Hello. My name is Atemate  I'm from Kenya. and I'm a student leader at St. Aloyssius the IC4 club. Thank you.,0,0,0,0
902,20171030,SAG,Denis,Thank you Atemate for availing yourself of the meetup at this time. Then I can see Alicia is also in the meetup. Please Alicia can you turn on your video so students from Spring Valley can see you. To introduce yourself.,0,0,1,1
903,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,Hi guys. My camera's not working right now but yeah my name is Alicia  I'm a junior in high school  I'm here up by part of NySci  New York Hall of Science in Queens  New York. We usually meet on Tuesdays or Wednesdays but since my schedule's a little conflicting I decided to meet you all today. So yeah I'm very excited to meet you all.,0,0,0,1
904,20171030,SAG,Denis,Thank you a lot Alicia. And you are welcome. I can see you have posted a question  which I think toward the end of the meetup we'll be able to tackle it. And at least try to find the solution. So going back to the presentation  Alison you are saying something. You just brief us about your project and I would like to display your project and as I display I'll be able to move as slowly and slowly as you explain  is that fine?,0,0,0,0
905,20171030,SAG,Denis,So this your presentation and may you please  maybe explain for us as I'll be moving slowly and slowly as you explain. Make us understand better.,0,0,0,0
906,20171030,SVHS,Alison,Okay so on this front page this is actually a chart  the United States and the ranking of obesity and the percentage of each state. And so this is just an introduction to show that there is a problem. Exactly in the United States where there is a higher obesity rate which is only increasing as time goes on. So this here I'm talking about how we are facing a rise of many diseases that are all caused from food. Well mostly caused by food. And this leads to more and more people relying on hospitals to treat these diseases  but unfortunately we've only seen a pattern where they're only treating the symptoms through a cycle of drugs. And my question here is who is responsible for this epidemic? Is it the food system? Is it the healthcare system? Or simply the individual and society where we are living in? So yeah. And this is just a photo of things that actually contribute to bad health. And so this is one of my questions  is what is the healthcare and food industry doing? And here I have a quote by New York Times showing how much money that America is spending to treat obesity  diabetes  and other diseases which is a lot of money. And so this is all mainly linked to the western diet. So yeah  the industry's making tons of money on selling fast food and treating all these diseases. So this being said  with all the healthcare industry and the food industry  and all the money they're making  why would they want to help us if they're making so much money off of our addiction and sickness? And so now I'm gonna be going into the standard American diet  and the dysfunction that it has  but it's targeted as healthy  and it's so normalized that we don't even question the health of what we're consuming. So I'll be starting out with milk because it's heavily enforced through the standard American diet. And so through the study of Harvard University they actually found that the more consumption of milk it has a higher risk of bone fractures. And the milk industry actually targets this product as giving stronger bones because of it's calcium. Which is very crazy because most people don't actually know this. And even in the other study that it has a higher risk of death rate caused by heart disease and cancer which is also very surprising. So thee videos  these videos are kind of lengthy so I'll just kind of briefly talk about what the videos are. The first one on the left side actually talks about the link between bone fractures and milk consumption  and the other one talks about how milk actually turns on cancerous cells when you consume it  and when you don't consume it  it actually turns off cancerous cells. And we've actually be looking for a cure to cancer for a very long time  and although this is not a cure we have found that milk consumption has a link to cancer so I think this is very profound information.,1,0,0,0
907,20171030,SAG,Denis,Should I play one of the videos?,0,0,0,0
908,20171030,SVHS,Alison,So now we'll be talking about meat because that's heavily consumed in the standard American diet. So this study is showing the relationship between cardiovascular disease and meat. And not surprisingly we found that there's a higher risk of cardiovascular disease caused by the significant amount of bad cholesterol which is called LDL. Also Harvard University found that red meat substantially contributes to premature death and a daily serving increases the risk of death by 13% and if it's processed meat it goes up to 20% and even the world health organization says that meat is a carcinogen which is something that causes cancer. By saying that 50 grams which is equivalent to one hot dog increases cancer by 18%. And so now I'm gonna be talking about what's the problem with doctors treating their patients. So what we've seen with doctors is they rarely question the role of diet in their patients. And actually they found that a plant based diet cures most of these diseases. But we have found that many doctors don't actually know this because the first thing they go to is pharmaceutical drugs which actually hurt the liver  the kidneys  and all of our organs inside when the plant based diet it has a success rate of so high and like doctors aren't promoting this. Like why is their first option pharmaceutical drugs? And a plant based diet has no near the benefits that pharmaceutical drugs do. So yeah. That's what  and this video here talks about how doctors are constantly prescribing drugs. How one drug could be solving one problem but consuming that drug could solve another issue. So yeah  so this video actually talks about that. So what is a plant based diet? And what is recommended for optimal health and to prevent and cure many of these diseases that we're facing today? And it's actually a plant based diet  it sounds exactly what it is. It's just based on plants this includes nuts  seeds  grains  fruit  legumes  and other whole foods and plant based items. No meat  no dairy  no eggs  processed sugar  added salts  oils  and enriched wheat or grain. So basically the idea of this diet is you consume everything that benefits your body  and you don't consume anything that's bad for your body which is not a hard rule to follow. And so how should we address this issue? We have seen that food is actually very much harming to our body and we can see this in the statistics we found with the rise of all these diseases. And the food and health industry is feeding our addiction with both drugs and food. And the western diet has such a bad relationship with food that sometimes we can't even recognize the addiction of food that we have. And so yeah the solution is treating people with a plant based diet. And if the majority of these people had a plant based diet the hospitals would be nearly empty. Not as many people would have these diseases. And the foods that are causing people to become sick would go out of business. And everyday people have a choice to make of eating something good or bad. They're either promoting their health and wellness or promoting their death. So yeah I just ask everyone to eat healthier foods and we have power in our hands by what we eat. So we control the food and health industry and they don't control us. So the power lies within all of us and we have a change. So yeah.,1,0,0,0
909,20171030,SAG,Denis,That was really a wonderful presentation. And I really like the way you have done it. Before maybe I comment on your presentation  I would like to invite maybe the other participants to say something about your presentation. Atemate please?,1,0,1,1
910,20171030,SAG,Ateamate,Okay. What I can say about the presentation  it's awesome. I like the content. Especially it has got more of biological facts. And also apart from just learning  it helps our particular life. It practically. So I really like the presentation so much.,1,0,0,1
911,20171030,SAG,Denis,Thanks a lot Atemate. I think that's a very encouraging comment from her. I would also like to invite Alicia to say something about Alison's Sway on food and health.,0,0,1,1
912,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,Yeah so I really liked how throughout the presentation you have many different sources. You had a lot of videos and informative information. And I also like how you connected it to social media and like the Got Milk commercial I thought that was very beneficial but also very smart-sensed. There was a  there's a lot of small talk concerning oh meat causes you cancer  but we don't really know in depth what specifically causes cancer or what molecules or what proteins are really what's harmful to your body  so it was very insightful.,1,1,0,1
913,20171030,SAG,Denis,Thank you a lot Alicia. Now what I want to say about the presentation. various areas. For example I have noticed a good use of visual images where you talked about meat and the background image you used and the background is the image of the meat. Then the videos were also used so that the moment you read the presentation and want to get more information about the meaning it's also a and that was really nice. Then again there's what you call the reference also. You talk about the New York Times. New York Times  according to New York Times  this and this. I think that's a very nice one for the reference. Then again there's also evident link where you have information but a link there that can and be able to take you to more areas where you can get more information. Again  I would like to appreciate you for your topic into you are talking about the food and health  about the obesity and so on  so you are able to put it into demonstrations where you talk about the problem  talk about the and that was really nice. Then again  you are able to  you had a good introduction and you're also able to have a good milk is good but so you actually appreciate the. Thank you a lot. Do you have anything to say about the presentation?,1,1,1,1
914,20171030,SVHS,Jake,I just wanna say that Alison first off did a great job on the presentation. And this is my first time being here  and it's great to see all you guys. Nice to meet all of you. I hope to see you all in the future and work together with you guys.,1,0,0,1
915,20171030,SAG,Denis,Thanks a lot.,0,0,0,0
916,20171030,SAG,Ateamate,Dennis ask a question to the students from Spring Valley. Okay I'm sorry I didn't give the introduction so I want to know your names. Forgive me for ,0,0,1,0
917,20171030,SVHS,Alison,Well I'm Alison from Spring Valley High School. And this is my first year here. But I went to the last global meeting. And I really enjoyed collaborating with everyone and making sure that I could get my ideas out there and have a voice in this community.,0,0,0,1
918,20171030,SVHS,Jake,And I'm Jake. From Spring Valley as well. And this is my very first time here. I just learned about this organization just two weeks ago. And it seems very interesting and I just want to help and work with other people and meet new friends.,0,0,0,1
919,20171030,SAG,Denis,That's really nice Jake and Alison. Atemate do you have another question?,0,0,1,0
920,20171030,SAG,Denis,Okay. Thank you. I wanted to ask a question to Alison about the presentation. What motivated you to prepare such a nice presentation?,1,0,0,0
921,20171030,SVHS,Alison,So what  can you repeat the question?,0,0,0,0
922,20171030,SAG,Denis,What actually motivated you to prepare this nice presentation?,1,0,0,0
923,20171030,SVHS,Alison,Well for me I've actually been learning about this for  like I just knew this stuff for a long time. 'Cause I actually adapted to plant based diet and I'm actually vegan for three years now. So knowing all this information I think it was just a great idea that I could actually share this professionally with someone. Cause I just know that this information is so important and if I'm able to share this information with other people I could be saving other people's lives. So that's why I decided to do it.,1,0,0,0
924,20171030,SAG,Denis,I think for me you have saved my life because I didn't know all this information about milk. Because we have said milk is good but I've just realized there are other side effects of it. And again the meat. It was a really nice presentation. And the structure. The way you introduced it the way you end it. All the features you used. It was a nice one. And that's why I asked you that question. Because even the last meetup you had the same idea of food and health but you were not able to bring it that clearly. And I would like to appreciate the fact that at this meetup you are able to at least prepare Sway about it.,1,0,0,1
925,20171030,SVHS,Alison,Thank you Denis,0,0,0,0
926,20171030,SAG,Denis,Thank you a lot. Any other comment? Any other question about Alison's Sway?,0,0,0,0
927,20171030,SAG,Denis,If there's no other question,0,0,0,0
928,20171030,SAG,Ateamate,Denis the question that on the chat window  did Alison  did you work on alone or was it a group Sway? Who worked on this Sway? Could you add names on the Sway? Another question what would you like to ,0,0,1,0
929,20171030,SVHS,Alison,So yeah I actually worked on this presentation alone. And answering this question from Zach  what would I like to encourage others to consider about adding or considering adding to or contributing to it.,1,0,0,0
931,20171030,SVHS,Alison,Yeah cause I know this is a very broad topic. And like I barely touched on a lot of these subjects. And there's so much depth into this topic that I could readdress it. So yeah I strongly encourage everyone to add onto this because there's so much more that could be addressed in this presentation. On this topic. So.,1,0,0,0
932,20171030,SAG,Denis,Okay. I hope Zach is content with the answer to the question. And that's nice. Thank you there to show that he's contended. Then again  if there is no other comment or question I would like to ask if maybe Marianna's around to share her presentation? Either Marianna or Trinity or Hermon? Is Marianna around or Trinity or Hermon to share their presentation?,0,0,1,0
933,20171030,SVHS,Alison,They're not here. I know Marianna she had to leave and Trinity wasn't actually able to make it out today.,0,0,0,0
934,20171030,SAG,Denis,Okay thank you. Then Hermon? Do you have  let me check.,0,0,0,0
935,20171030,SVHS,Israel,Dennis this is Israel. Just so you know Marianna needed to leave like I mentioned to you earlier. She was here she was just ready to start our meeting and then she received a phone call and so she had to leave. Trinity she sent me an email yesterday telling me that today's her dad's birthday so happy birthday  and so they had some plans last minute. And Hermon she needed to go to practice a cross country practice today. I think they're gonna go to playoffs or something like that so she needed to be there. So please stay tuned  those presentations are coming along the way. By the way we at Students Create  you wanna tell them about the way we work like your health is connected to cross country and then?,0,0,0,0
936,20171030,SVHS,Alison,So I know that Marianna and Trinity actually partnered up  and they had their own project ideas. Like I know Marianna was doing natural disasters and Trinity was doing how we could provide energy to places that are effected by natural disasters. So they actually partnered up to work together on how to solve these issues. Which I thought was very cool. And I know someone was doing a project on cross country. And how that could be relating to my project about the health and wellness attribute of my project.,1,0,0,1
937,20171030,SAG,Denis,Okay. Thank you Alison for that. And maybe to ask Israel this  we would  would they be able to make it maybe the next meetup maybe next week?,0,0,0,1
938,20171030,SVHS,Alison,When was the next meetup?,0,0,0,0
939,20171030,SAG,Denis,Will Marianna  Trinity be able to share their presentation next week? In the next meetup?,0,0,0,0
940,20171030,SAG,Denis,Oh I hope so. Then maybe move away from presentation. There's some questions that were asked. Alicia. Alicia asked  what scientific phenomenon do you find most fascinating? Alicia  are you around?,1,0,1,0
941,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,Yeah still here.,0,0,0,0
942,20171030,SAG,Denis,Yeah please may you ask your question again?,0,0,0,0
943,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,So my question was what scientific phenomenon do you find most fascinating or any scientific topic in general that you would love to study in depth?,1,0,0,0
944,20171030,SAG,Denis,Okay. Thank you. So the question is which are the scientific phenomenons that you find most fascinating? Let me take an example of the one I found more interesting it's about the sailing stone. Let me share a screen with you about this. Let me just share a screen with you. So this sailing stone you can also call it sliding rocks  or moving stones  so these are where rocks move and inscribe along smooth valley without human or animal intervention. So you can find that there's some areas where you find stones then especially in the Northern like Canada  northern hemisphere so you find the stone they just move without animals or human intervention. So I find that what cause the movement of these stones. But to this century the science are saying that because they normally move mostly during the melting of the ice sheet where a storm is at a certain point then when a storm is on the then that water act as a lubricant. And make the stone to move. So most of the concepts I have not to discover but I just found that to share. So that's one of my example of some of the most fascinating phenomenons that are available. So maybe I really appreciate if you can share yours.,1,0,1,0
945,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,Sorry you said me?,0,0,0,0
946,20171030,SAG,Denis,Pardon? In case you have anything you can share but since you asked the question I would like to give the chance to Alison and Jake to share something about the most interesting scientific phenomenon that they know.,0,0,1,0
947,20171030,SVHS,Jake,Yeah I know one. A few years back I went on a field trip up in California and outside of San Francisco there is a place called the mystery spot. And it's a couple of hills that visually speaking gravity doesn't work the way you think it would. So whenever you go there  there's like a few houses there you can walk in. And you'll feel like you're walking normally but you'll be walking at about a 30 degree slant to the side. And they have a cool thing you can do there where they have a board and it's placed flat and it looks flat  and if you put a ball on one end it rolls up the board instead of down. And that's because of the  I think it's the magnetic pole has some weird force around there. To wherever everything just looks like it's slanted to the side. Even though it's really not.,1,0,0,0
948,20171030,SAG,Denis,Wow. That's really nice. Alicia do you have any  do you want any verification maybe why it would lean to the side. Anything for Jake?,0,0,1,1
949,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,Sorry can you repeat that?,0,0,0,0
950,20171030,SAG,Denis,Do you need any clarification from Jake on what he has said?,0,0,0,0
951,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,I was just curious as to where he heard that story.,0,0,0,0
952,20171030,SVHS,Jake,I have actually been there. It's called the Mystery Spot in California. They have their own website. There's videos you can look up online about it. It's a really famous tourist attraction by San Francisco.,1,0,0,0
953,20171030,SAG,Denis,Thank you Jake. Atemate do you have anything you find interesting  scientific phenomenon that you find interesting?,0,0,1,0
954,20171030,SAG,Ateamate,First there is volcanic fires. When they erupt the you can go ahead and watch some videos but you see like when they erupt they form that fire. Even when let's say fire something like let's say a hill  you might think it's an eruption only to find the a friend of mine shared with me okay there's a fire that occurred at a hill. This shows like oh my god an eruption and this so beautiful but.,1,0,0,0
955,20171030,SAG,Denis,So Atemate if I may ask  you have said that it was ,0,0,1,0
956,20171030,SAG,Ateamate,It was in Namibia it was  as in those fire around the hill. And the smog  and then the sparkles of fire  and it just looked like an eruption with the rocks exploded. When they explode out it just look like an eruption.,1,0,0,0

965,20171030,IC4,Zach,Oh great. Can you see my screen now?,0,0,0,0
966,20171030,IC4,Zach,Good. So I have been looking at this map  I believe it's the map of the USA  and there's a lot of information on this map. I don't know if Alison  can you just say a little bit more about this map and what it tells us about please?,1,0,1,0
967,20171030,SVHS,Alison,Yeah. So the chart actually shows the percentage in the population according to each state. So the purple is 30% or more. So you can see that Virginia  Mississippi  and Louisiana have more than 30% of the population obese. While a majority is either in the orange or red which is 25 to 29% or 20 to 24%. So this is just an example of the statistics of the rise in obesity and other diseases that could cause that.,1,0,0,0
968,20171030,IC4,Zach,So what's fascinating to me is the stats in actually these two that I can see  does anyone have an idea of why that is so different from the others?,1,0,0,0
969,20171030,SVHS,Alison,That's a very good question. I know that it's all about environment and culture. You adapt to your environment so if a lot of people are eating unhealthy foods. It's more likely that obesity can arise out of that. But as far as why it's those states in particular  I don't know.,1,0,0,0
970,20171030,IC4,Zach,Probably it would be interesting for probably someone else to try and look up that and I can also see the other yellows  there's this one here and the other one which I tend to think is the lowest. And also Hawaii here. I thought that was very fascinating to me. Two of them could be like really and three would be really low and yellow. Maybe that's something worth to look at. And also just looking across the whole map I can see towards the western side it tends to be higher  and this other side tends to be a little bit lower than the rest. It might be worth someone investigating and really looking at it. So  going back to your questions here  who is responsible  the food system  the health system  or simply the individual. What was your conclusion about these questions?,1,0,0,0
971,20171030,SVHS,Alison,Well for me  I know that the food system is the one providing us for us to consume all these bad products. But the health system is the one who's not enforcing a healthy diet. And the individual is all feeding these lies and allowing this to happen. But I also believe that the power is within the people. So if we start educating about this problem. Then we could start having a voice and knowing that this problem can definitely be solved if we see the power in ourselves. 'Cause usually we don't see the power in ourselves when we have someone higher above us  for example the government or even all these industries  so yeah I think it's kind of like  it's everyone. Everyone kind of contributed to this big problem.,1,0,0,0
972,20171030,IC4,Zach,Great. Atemate and probably Denis  I'm sure this problem is not just a problem in America alone. But even here in Kenya it's beginning to be a problem and I'm sure some of our students would be interested in also investigating this and working with you on this. Probably we will share with them and see if you can collaborate and work together on this together and see if you can take your presentation to the next level. Thank you very much for preparing a wonderful Sway. Thank you.,1,0,0,1
973,20171030,SVHS,Alison,Thank you Zach. I'll definitely look into the map and how the diet can be affected from the west side to the east side.,1,0,0,0
974,20171030,IC4,Zach,Right thanks.,0,0,0,0
975,20171030,SAG,Denis,Thank you Zach for sharing. Thank you. Alison did you want to say something?,0,0,1,1
976,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,If I may add one more comment about specifically ranging from the west to east  one thing that I was considering maybe colonization  and also the cultivation of different cultures. Because specifically with the southern states because a lot of their food was based off of plantation and farms  where they grew a lot of corn  rice  and all these potentially starchy foods. So that was one thing I was thinking about in terms of  that may not be the most healthy things to eat especially now days. And also ultimately since in America there are a bunch of different cultures  we all are trying to assimilate into one American identity  but it's also the issue of trying to accommodate to all these different cultures without offending one another. Especially in school where perhaps if one person can't eat beef  how do you accommodate to them? And also different allergies  and there's a lot to consider in terms of making meal plans. They try to enforce the  what's it called  the plate with the different sections of like  this is how much dairy you should have. What do you do for those who can't eat dairy? I think it's also a greater issue of trying to pertain to all these different cultures and also trying to have everyone trying to make sure that everyone is able to have a definition of healthy. And make sure that they're eating the right way.,1,0,0,0
977,20171030,SAG,Denis,Okay. I think that was very clear from Alicia. And also from Zach. That was a good question and also a comment on what you made. You can now see you made that great impact when you share it with people. Then again  because we have like 8 minutes I would like to go to the last question. Just finish on this last question. The last question says  let me check  should plastic bags be banned from the grocery stores? Should plastic bags be banned? So maybe to say something about that  something small about that. Plastic bags should be banned  my own opinion  plastic bags should be banned from grocery stores. I often go to the store and buy one or two  and I'm given so many bags. I feel that we have become extremely because the moment you go to the shop you are given these bags then you dump them to the environment. Because they are unbiodegradable they end up no decomposing and adds contamination to the soil and to the environment. And again when the animals eat this pollutant bags  they can die and all that. So what I was asking  do you have any other solution  do you propose or oppose the fact the plastic bags should be banned from the grocery store? Atemate? Do you have anything?,1,0,1,1
978,20171030,SAG,Ateamate,Okay plastic bags are to think of animals  environment  actually a suggestion I have  you're going to buy a and then you just  let's say you are from work or something of that sort. Then you don't have any place prepared to buy but you need to buy something to go home with.,1,0,0,0
979,20171030,SAG,Denis,That's really nice Atemate. Another comment or any proposal of what the statement said? Jake do you have anything to say?,0,0,1,1
980,20171030,SVHS,Alison,So as far as,0,0,0,0
981,20171030,SAG,Denis,About the plastic bags. Yeah  yeah.,0,0,0,0
982,20171030,SVHS,Alison,I was thinking that if we stop producing them  they'll still exist because for an example  if you take home your grocery bags in plastic bags  you could always bring them back. So as long as we're reusing them and not producing them again  I think it would be more efficient that way. And eventually I feel like we could just start recycling all this stuff rather than just producing more and more plastic that will just eventually go in the ocean and the rest of the environment.,1,0,0,0
983,20171030,SAG,Denis,Anymore comment?,0,0,0,0
984,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,I think it would be very difficult to eliminate plastic bags completely. Especially since it's such a staple associated with going to the grocery store  you're gonna get a plastic bag unless you're committed to having your own bag that you bring with you everywhere. So I think the greater solution would be to figure out how to repurpose bags. Or figure out some way to use plastic bags in a compelling way that'll pertain to the public. So one of the  so at NySci we have one of these internships where students are able to explore the maker space and work with a bunch of different tools to make a project. And so one of the projects of this last intake was that they used plastic bags  and I forgot what chemical they used but it would disintegrate them and then they would make a mold in which they could create lamps. So the lamp would be made of plastic bags. And I found that so fascinating because to take this like household item to make into something that you could repurpose in your house  I thought it was the most innovative thing. And so I hope that we can find innovative ways to repurpose plastic bags. Because unfortunately they're cheap and easy to produce so it'll be difficult to eliminate them completely. But I think finding ways to reuse them is the best solution.,1,0,0,0
985,20171030,SAG,Ateamate,Okay Alicia  can you imagine a situation in where our country plastic bags are banned? Like if you're found with a plastic bag there's a fine you're supposed to pay?,1,0,0,0
986,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,You're fined if you're found with a plastic bag?,0,0,0,0
987,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,Oh wow. So what do you use to carry your things?,1,0,0,0
988,20171030,SAG,Ateamate,You need to like be prepared for shopping so always carry your bag or if not there are these some bags but not plastic. but you just need to be prepared for your shopping at the market. supposed to be having your own bag or buy another bag which is not plastic.,1,0,0,0
989,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,Well that's great to hear to be honest. That's something I did not know  so thank you for enlightening me about that.,0,0,0,1
990,20171030,SAG,Denis,Okay thank you. Yeah?,0,0,0,0
991,20171030,SVHS,Israel,Also I would like to share that I think it has to deal with the culture also. For example  when you go to Mexico you go to the supermarket in Mexico called el Mercado  the majority of the people they bring their own bags. And so they don't provide you with plastic bags  and so you have to bring your own bag. And so if we train future generations to go out and do that every time they go to the supermarket  then things will change drastically not to use a lot of plastic bags.,1,0,0,0
992,20171030,SAG,Denis,Sure. I get you Israel.,0,0,0,0
993,20171030,SAG,Denis,Sure. I hope any other comment about what we have discussed today. About the presentation that Alison made. And also question that Alicia posted. And also my question. I hope there's not any other question on that  so because of time I would like to appreciate everyone for availing themselves of the meetup and sharing nice presentation. And also challenging other people with the question. I want to give 30 second for everyone just to say  including Atemate  on how the meeting was. Just say what your concerning the meetup. Like a concluding statement.,0,0,1,1
994,20171030,SAG,Ateamate,I think the meetup was so great. It went well  especially the presentation from Alison. It thought that was so great  I got a lot of content from your presentation. it was also great meeting thank you.,1,0,0,1

1000,20171030,NYSCI,Alicia,Yeah I enjoyed this meeting a lot. And I'm glad to see some new faces  some old faces  and it was great to hear from everyone again. And I loved your presentation Alison. And I've never used Sway before so this was definitely something new to me. So I'm definitely looking forward to learning about all your upcoming projects and to make some of my own. So  excited for the future.,0,1,0,1
1001,20171030,SAG,Denis,Thank you a lot. I would like to appreciate you for the positive response. And when you look at the chat window  there's a link I've just posted there. You can click that link  go to the website  then maybe write your comment there. Your comment about the meetup and some of the things you are expected to write on that  maybe let me brief you on what is expected. So you're expected to maybe  when you are writing the comment these are some of the questions that maybe you might have. What are some specific STEM things you learned? Is there anything that especially please you or disappointed you in today's meetup? What skills can you develop or used in your meeting to be more effective? Is there anything that led you to think differently about yourself  about STEM  school  and others. concerning the meetup. So I'd like to after this meetup  you go to reflection form and write something. Immediately after the meetup. Thank you a lot.,0,0,0,0
1002,20171030,SVHS,Israel,Thank you Denis  thank you everybody it's a pleasure seeing you. We're looking forward for next global meeting. You guys rock. Let me tell you.

Yeah like for Jennifer and Alex it's okay. For AJ Cabrillo please. Yeah yeah that's okay. Yeah yeah good. That position okay. Thank you. So maybe. So maybe before we start  I would like us to go through some of the few things that we need to know that will help us as we continue the meeting. So we need to know that these meetings they're about just us meeting together and sharing topics related to science  technology  and engineer. And I will request if  in case you're not speaking then you turn your microphone off so that we can prevent that background noise. Then again  on your screen there's also a chat window. Please put it on so in case there is any issue or question just write there  okay? Then at the end you also have the reflection forms that you need to fill. So in reflection form actually you are expected to write there what do you feel about the meeting. Just write your own what you feel  what did not go well  just comment. Yeah thank you very much. So maybe before you start I would like us to introduce ourselves. I know most of you don't know me. My name is Denis  I'm from Kenya  and I'm IC4 facilitator and also educator. I used to learn more about IC4 and for now I'm teaching other kids on how to make video and share with you. In case you'll be available for the next meeting Saturday 5PM Kenyan time you'll be able to see some of us students okay. So my name's Denis. So maybe Alexander can you say something brief about yourself. And I would like us to feel free.,0,0,1,0
1033,20171018,CHS,Alex,Okay so my name is Alex I'm 15 at Cabrillo in California of USA. I don't really know what to say about myself.,0,0,0,0

1038,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,Hi  my name's Jennifer. I go to Cabrillo and I'm a tenth grader just like Alex. IC4 just started last year but we weren't all that prepared  we didn't know most of it. But now we made it to the club and I'm the secretary.,0,0,0,0
1039,20171018,SAG,Denis,Very welcome I'm happy to meet you for the first time if I'm not wrong. Thank you. Yes.,0,0,0,1
1040,20171018,CHS,AJ,Hi I'm AJ I'm from Cabrillo. I'm a tenth grader just like Alex and Jennifer. I am the Vice President of IC4 right now. Yeah.,0,0,0,0
1041,20171018,SAG,Denis,Wow thank you. And you're the Vice President?,0,0,0,0
1042,20171018,SAG,Denis,Yeah thank you a lot yeah. So the first step is always introduction  then we go to sharing our videos  then in case you have any questions you'll be free to ask. So maybe I'll expect you to have maybe some of the ideas that you'd like to share with us. And also for me I have a video that I'd like us to watch then we discuss then  then I'll give you a chance to comment on the video. So maybe to start with my video  how many of you have visit the online? The website? That I've just posted there? The reflection form? So in the reflection form there's a video posted about how solar panel works  so maybe I'd like to share screen with you so you can watch this video. Then after that we discuss. So let me just share screen.,0,0,0,0
1043,20171018,SAG,Denis,Are you able to see the screen?,0,0,0,0
1044,20171018,CHS,AJ,Is there an audio to the video?,0,0,0,0
1045,20171018,SAG,Denis,Are you able to view the video?,0,0,0,0
1046,20171018,CHS,AJ,We can't hear anything,0,0,0,0
1047,20171018,SAG,Denis,So that was the video. Have you watched the video? Yeah. So maybe to brief you something about the video. The video was about the solar panel and I was just explaining how the solar panel works. So some of the things I've looked at  some of the that measure the solar panel  and how a solar panel works. I hope you know what solar panel is. Do you know what solar panel is?,1,0,0,0
1048,20171018,SAG,Denis,Yes it's always black and mostly you might find it on top of the roof. So any comment on the video? Or any question?,1,0,0,0
1049,20171018,CHS,AJ,Well I think it was a pretty interesting idea cause I didn't know there's a certain angle for it to work efficiently.,1,0,0,1
1050,20171018,SAG,Denis,Yeah thank you. But I hope for now you have known it. So mostly what happened with the solar panel it always painted black and carefully there's transparent glass. So all the parts normally have the function. Like the black thing in it  it always so what happens to put your solar panel on top of the roof and the sunlight  then the sunshine from the sun which you call the photons will heat the metal. So the moment it hit the metal the metal will emit the electrons. So the movement of such electrons are what produce electricity and we use them in our homes. So some of the functions we've talked about  the it depend on which position you place your solar panel  then again you we are talk about cold season and hot season. Summer and winter. Yeah. Any comment from Alexander?,1,0,1,0
1051,20171018,CHS,Alex,I had a question.,0,0,0,0
1052,20171018,CHS,Alex,Would you be able to use solar energy during a blackout?,1,0,0,0
1053,20171018,SAG,Denis,Yeah it's possible. What normally happens  the moment you place your solar panel on top of the roof for it to charge  I think  black out as in? What do you mean by blackout cause I normally know only electricity can go for blackout but solar but now compared to where the sunlight  the amount of energy it will produce will be much lower when it is in shade. Yeah. Any comment Alexander still?,1,0,1,0
1054,20171018,CHS,Alex,I think it was a very good video. I learned a lot from the video about solar energy and solar panels.,1,0,0,1
1055,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,I have a question,0,0,0,0
1056,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,About the video. I was wondering if there's a limited amount of energy it can collect?,1,0,0,0
1057,20171018,SAG,Denis,May you pardon please?,0,0,0,0
1058,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,If there's a limited amount of energy the solar panel can collect?,1,0,0,0
1059,20171018,SAG,Denis,Yeah sure. That's true. It depend with the size of the solar panel. We have the bigger ones and we have the smaller ones. I know the smaller one cannot produce electricity that is used in. The amount of energy produced by the solar panel depend on the size of the solar panels. And the number of cells in it. The bigger the solar panels  the more the number of cells. The more the number of cells the more energy to produce. Okay. Yeah. In case you have solar panels that's like this. Let me maybe the size is this okay? You can't expect it to produce electricity that is used in big industries but the then it produce more energy. So it depend on the size. Anymore question  comment? So thank you for watching the video and I really appreciate for your comments and courage yeah thank you. Is there anything you want to share with us?,1,0,1,1
1060,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,We haven't made any videos so far but we did have some ideas that we were thinking of doing during this year. We were thinking of doing bio-diversity project we're planning to fundraise for a trip to Catalina and we were going to research about the land  the people maybe and ,1,0,0,0
1061,20171018,SAG,Denis,So about the diversity project what will it be all about?,1,0,0,0
1062,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,We were thinking of looking at the different organisms that live in the sea and maybe the people that lives in the region.,1,0,0,0
1063,20171018,SAG,Denis,Yeah I get it  yeah. It ,0,0,0,0
1064,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,Well last year we took a trip to Catalina and we saw the organisms they have there and it kind of struck our curiosity and so we plan to do it again this year,1,0,0,0
1065,20171018,SAG,Denis,Okay. Do you expect to start the project soon about the diversity?,1,0,0,0
1066,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,We're still in the middle of planning but around March next year that's when we'll plan to go.,0,0,0,0
1067,20171018,SAG,Denis,I'm really hoping to see it. And I hope you will share with us in the meetings. Alexander is there anything you like? Yeah? ,1,0,1,0

1084,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,I think it's a really great improvement in communication. Because instead of like being next to each other to work on it we're able to be in different places while working on the same thing. And sharing our own ideas and.,1,1,0,0

1088,20171018,CHS,AJ,I think there's a positive effect and negative effect. Because communication can also effect kids mostly kids to be on their phone most of the times than actually communicating with like communicating about their education or finding more about stuff. Yeah. Yeah.,1,1,0,0

1103,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,Yes near oceans  lakes,0,0,0,0
1104,20171018,SAG,Denis,I do live near mountains and islands. But it depends. There's sometimes upcountry we live near a lake. Lake Victoria. Please try to do a research about Lake Victoria there's something so unique about it. So that's where we live. Lake Victoria is actually the second biggest lake in the world after Lake Superior in Northern America there's a lake called Lake Superior. Lake is actually the largest. It's a very big one. So in my country I live near Lake Victoria but when I come to the capital city in Nairobi. More forest and it's away from the lake. So why have you asked that question? Is there anything so unique about living near a lake body?,1,0,0,0
1105,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,We can compare how different it is if you live near a body of water and you don't,1,0,0,0
1106,20171018,SAG,Denis,I do. I do. I told you that I do and I told you that I do live both in highlands and near lakes especially when I'm living in upcountry I'm living near a lake. so is there any comparison you like?,1,0,0,0
1107,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,We can compare the different animals that live there,1,0,0,0
1108,20171018,SAG,Denis,Yeah we can cause  can you take for me some of the animals that live near maybe the ocean where you are? Cause maybe to the lake Victoria ,1,0,0,0
1109,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,We live near and at Catalina we saw sea hairs and planktons.,1,0,0,0
1110,20171018,SAG,Denis,Yes Jennifer please continue.,0,0,0,0
1111,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,Well there's some that  well when we were learning at Catalina they said some animals migrated there and they began to adapt there as a result.,1,0,0,0
1112,20171018,SAG,Denis,I went to last year to lake do you know lake? Have you heard of lake? It actually known for producing the hot water. Was really swimming and I thought fish swimming in a bowl of water. I know was wondering how do the fish survive? That's possible.,1,0,0,0
1113,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,In hot water?,1,0,0,0
1114,20171018,SAG,Denis,Yeah cause I don't know hot water like warm water yeah,1,0,0,0
1115,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,They can mate with other fishes and create a new fish but with yeah inheriting genetics from the person or the fish,1,0,0,0
1116,20171018,SAG,Denis,AJ?,0,0,1,0
1117,20171018,CHS,AJ,We saw fishes have like genes that can resist hot water and like Jennifer said they could mate with another to make more of those and be able to live in water.,1,0,0,0
1118,20171018,SAG,Denis,Sure. Okay. Alexander do you think that's possible? Are fish living in hot water?,1,0,1,0
1119,20171018,CHS,Alex,Maybe it is possible that they can adapt to their surroundings. But if it's like in boiling hot water I don't think there can be any life forms,1,0,0,0
1120,20171018,SAG,Denis,Yeah it is not really boiling but just warm water. So when I look at warm water maybe warm water and oxygen do not have sufficient oxygen fish really living near and it is warm. To be there's no oxygen inside there.,1,0,0,0
1121,20171018,SAG,Denis,I'm asking  do you know the relationship between warm water  cold water and oxygen? You know that cold water contain more oxygen than warm water. Yeah. Adequate oxygen. So I'm wondering how's this kind of fish able to live here and the water is warm. To me there's not enough oxygen.,1,0,0,0
1122,20171018,CHS,Jennifer,There could be any plants under water that produces oxygen. yeah.,1,0,0,0

1124,20171018,CHS,AJ,We would like to know what Kenya has or what Kenya what buildings in Kenya still exist today?,1,0,0,0
1125,20171018,SAG,Denis,That's a really nice question AJ. The kind of building that exist in Kenya. So in Kenya we have the traditional buildings and the modern buildings. You know traditional buildings  the grass houses in the village. Grass houses. Can I demonstrate? So let me do a small demonstration. Let me do just a small demonstration. So in Kenya when I talk about the how they look like. So in the village you'll find some houses like this. and here's the window. So such houses they are found in the village. So in the this is where the grass is. made of mud and traditionally satisfied? AJ?,1,0,1,1
1126,20171018,SAG,Denis,AJ please?,0,0,1,0
1127,20171018,CHS,AJ,I wanted to ask another question. What do you think is the reason why some old buildings still exist today?,1,0,0,0
1128,20171018,SAG,Denis,Old building exist? that's really nice what is it?,1,0,0,1
1129,20171018,CHS,Alex,I searched and it's supposed to be African architecture. Because we were wondering about old architecture and why it still stands today.,1,0,0,0
1130,20171018,SAG,Denis,Can you show me one more time?,0,0,0,0
1131,20171018,SAG,Denis,Wow. Thank you a lot. It's really great. To share the link chat window. No don't worry about it. Don't AJ can you remind me what you ask? What was it?,0,0,0,0
1132,20171018,CHS,AJ,Oh what geometric shapes or what shapes does the architecture consist for it to stand still until today?,1,0,0,0
1133,20171018,SAG,Denis,So some of the shape that architecture  oh before you ask of that I can remember you ask of why some old building still exist. So one of the reason why they still exist  they have been preserved for then another one  because of maybe many for example recently a few months ago Pope Francis came in Kenya and he visit some of the areas. So you find that some of the areas he visited can be preserved so more people can always come and see where the pope went. Again the years present Barack Obama also came in Kenya in July I guess was it  March? Yeah. And visit some of the places and maybe slept in a tent so these places they have been preserved so people can come and see where US president slept it. For attraction. Another is for the beauty. Some of them look so good. I got example in Egypt. In Egypt you have the pyramids. They were there earlier  people built them and because of the beauty okay? They're so beautiful and people looking at them. Again it's about their history. That make the whole building to be there up till now. Then again I think it's more of this way. It's more like a triangle so there's always reason why it's triangular. For architecture they have their own reason why they draw the image of their building  there's some reasons. More question? If there's no more question  I would like to thank you a lot for participating in this meetup. And I really enjoyed your participation especially like Alexander  Jennifer  and AJ it's really nice to meet you people.
